168,ready for the tech press to flip out when apple announces the retail price for the gold apple watch edition apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize but the apple watch edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of the funny thing in this case is that apple is perfectly right to be charging that do you check out my counterpoint case against the gold apple watch gold is start with a little backgrounder in everyone has a vague sense that gold is even rabid internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the but most people understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold so this is a good place to begin the my calculations were also this was a bit of the now that it has some readership i realize i should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more here are the basic gold currently sells for between and per troy ounce and has been over per troy ounce for the last five gold contains pure gold and that term is regulated by one ounce of 18k gold occupies about cubic centimeters of volume since a typical gold alloy weighs about grams per gold currently sells for per gram per troy ounce or per cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and cc gets you a deployant it takes a few more to build a watch case anywhere from to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the so the buckle is worth and the watch case to just as raw this is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than gold watches are apply this to a watch imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm if it was solid this would equal cc of but a watch case so you have to leave room for the movement dial case back so just leave 5 mm of thickness all around making a hollow this equals cc x 36 x 10 32 x 26 x therefore the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost as of this a simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick gold would cost over a simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick gold would cost more than now consider the same shape but just 2 mm cc of gold worth pick your thickness and still looking at thousands of dollars worth of how does this translate in the real look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and this cartier tank mc is more in 18k this cartier tank mc is more in 18k the cartier tank mc measures 44 mm by 34 mm by mm extra for 18k cartier tank mc in stainless list cartier tank mc in 18k pink list the reverso squadra hometime measures mm by mm by 14 mm extra for 18k reverso squadra hometime in stainless list reverso squadra hometime in 18k pink list this list could go on and on but the gist is gold cases cost a lot more than stainless in fact pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under in any size and from any even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny chopard happy sport mini sells for most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either or less very slim and small or long out of production and with outdated then the swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra adding a gold bracelet to that bumps the price to certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch and the gold market is liquid like stocks and other there are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold and plenty of reserves so no company no matter how strong can expect favorable pricing from their another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against they price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year so they generally price somewhat higher than they would even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials labor distribution and profit in a the apple watch edition will cost a reason i picked those two watches for my both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm apple the cartier is a little smaller and the is a little larger but both represent a traditional offering in the and both cost more than with much of that price going to the gold case and matching and jony ive recently said that the historic cartier tank was one of his inspirations for the apple watch apple would be crazy to sell the apple watch edition for not going to so likely to find ways to reduce the cost first as we can see the apple watch case is highly rounded in all three although questionable from an esthetic standpoint this reduces the amount of material required by quite a second apple watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display sensors and third the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum not gold to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel could it be gold numerous reports state that it is a solid gold although apple has not apparently used the word in their press releases they do claim it is from and nowhere does it say it is plated or industry there are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and apple cannot break these any more than tiffany apple says that the apple watch will start at for that aluminum sport model and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel apple watch to be roughly it is reasonable to assume that the gold edition model will sell for substantially more than this with many suggesting or but remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of even with thin walls and a steel frame hard to see how apple could make a solid gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold is soft but apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as taking that at face value perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular this still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the the apple watch edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes a difference of about in terms of case so the smaller model could sell for less my prediction is that the 42 mm apple watch edition will retail for with the 38 mm apple watch edition retailing for this covers the cost of the gold case the internals manufacturing sales and profit and yet does not leave apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a or plated i will be shocked if the price is but i suppose possible with some finagling and if the smaller and it will not be any less than this is a this is a bonus given the very high price of the apple watch edition i predict that availability will be quite apple will likely create special spaces in certain apple store locations for the i further expect them to open special standalone apple edition boutiques to sell the watch edition accessories and perhaps other future needless to say many people disagree with and now that fireballed this post i imagine hear from lots of them real the gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch i assumed it would be quite thick and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k then the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen but others though he was most visually suspects it contains much less i think this number is way too low but a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely and it puts the raw gold at about at per gram of 18k although this is admittedly much much lower than my estimate it still illustrates my point that the apple watch edition is not going to be and i think way off but time will tell who is right and who is another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold rolex right off the bat one should point out that gold cost when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well something apple is apparently not going to do with the that rolex case contained grams of gold alloy but much much smaller than the apple watch and circular to a 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference while the 42mm apple watch is 156mm in use the magic of math to scale the rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and at but that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel and the apple watch is pretty so we can probably double this safely and come out with of gold in my mangled square rolex so there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the i can accept but take a step back and think about the final even if it contained less than of gold how much would it sell certainly not or you still have to account for the cost of everything else plus the intangibles of manufacturing and and profit for apple a hedge against the volatility of the price of so back at the estimate others have as greg koenig tweeted and forbes reported anyone thinks apple is charging less than for the edition they are smoking regardless of the total important to realize that the price of gold is in the seat when it comes to pricing the apple watch love to be wrong and i look forward to updating this thanks for

200,texas an islamic tribunal using sharia law in texas has been confirmed by breitbart the tribunal is operating as a organization in one of the attorneys for the tribunal said participation and acceptance of the decisions are breitbart texas spoke with one of the taher he said the tribunal operates under sharia law as a form of dispute said their organization is tribunal not a tribunal is defined by dictionary as court or forum of the four islamic attorneys call themselves not said the tribunal follows sharia law to resolve civil disputes in family and business he said they also resolve workplace in matters of divorce said that participation in the tribunal is voluntary a married couple cannot be considered divorced by the islamic community unless it is granted by the he compared their divorce known as as something similar to the catholic practice of annulment in that the church does not recognize civil divorce proceedings as ending a an article seems troubled by this though is a perfectly normal practice within religious groups in is right that catholics have long gone to catholic authorities to resolve certain questions related to orthodox jews have long gone to jewish religious courts a court is called a both to resolve marital matters and to resolve commercial some protestants sometimes do the 1 corinthians is often interpreted as calling for there are three ways in which these decisions have practical respect for the religious people may often feel personally obligated to follow the judgments of respected authorities on their religious for instance a catholic who get an annulment might feel obligated not to remarry even if he thinks that he should have gotten the annulment simply because he feels that god wants him to follow the teachings and social would observant muslims feel pressured to abide by a sharia ruling when that will affect how their coreligionists business partners neighbors and family members perceive you would orthodox jews feel the you bet and i expect that christians who operate within sufficiently devout and religiously homogeneous communities would have the same for an interesting but rare case of the legal system being asked to intervene to stop such social pressure and refusing to do so see paul watchtower bible tract think that even in the absence of the free exercise clause that were made in that case but that might be unavailable in many states following employment division smith a campaign urging people to shun the excommunicated would be protected under the free speech clause see naacp claiborne hardware indeed one common argument in favor of religiosity is that community pressure tends to lead people to abide by religious obligations to steal not to commit adultery and the flip side is that community pressure tends to lead people to abide by religious obligations that we might not agree with with a husband who mistreats you never remarry and so of course if there is also the threat of violence and not just community pressure then the law can step in to punish the violence and any explicit threats of but the possibility of such violence in rare cases allow the legal system to step in to block nonviolent social pressure in other the parties could also enter into a binding arbitration agreement under which they agree that the decision would be enforceable in civil such agreements are common with secular commercial arbitration even when the arbitration is supposed to apply law other than american law english law or french and they are also permissible for religious there are interesting questions about whether an arbitral decision is enforceable in secular american court if it applies substantive or procedural rules that discriminate based on race religion or i discuss this a bit in this post and the comments to it are also much worth but according to the breitbart texas article says that these tribunals do not conduct legally binding rather their decisions are followed when they are followed as a result of the acquiescence and community as a result these interesting questions arise religious communities have long had the right to use standard american contract law coupled with the standard american liberty to exert social pressure on your family members friends neighbors and business partners to have religious decisionmakers decide especially so when the decisions are enforced just by community own religious feelings or by social but that can also be so subject to some limitations when the parties to the dispute agree to binding arbitration again seem to be in play with the texas islamic the remedy for those who disapprove of the religious law is leaving the community the that is of course often very hard for personal and economic hard for hard for orthodox jews especially groups such as the satmar hard for mormons witnesses the amish and members of lots of other but a necessary aspect of american social and religious

conal would receive a call back to address the he describes that callback as with the rep not identifying which company she was calling from just starting out with can i help then she kept insisting that a technician had shown up for an appointment but specify which the rep then began asking him for the color of his so he tried the office again to let them know that the rep sent his way had failed miserably at her during this call he says that he mentioned that billing and accounting issues should probably be investigated by the public company accounting oversight board a oversight this ultimately led to two service calls where no one ever showed up and no explanations were but something did just not anything we know where you remember how we briefly mentioned above that conal worked for a large prestigious accounting comcast certainly noticed that fact especially since that firm is one that does business with at some point shortly after that call someone from comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss this led to an ethics investigation and subsequent dismissal from his a job where he says only received positive feedback and reviews for his comcast maintained that conal used the name of his employer in an attempt to get conal insists that he never mentioned his employer by name but believes that someone in the comcast office looked him up online and figured out where he when he was fired employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an from comcast that summarized conversations between conal and comcast but conal has never seen this in order to say whether accurate and comcast has thus far refused to release any tapes of the phone calls related to this and while his former employer did provide consulting services to comcast it was not the accounting firm that audited so conal quite see how mentioning the name of his employer would have helped gain him any in response to a letter from lawyer he has not filed a lawsuit but not out of the question senior deputy general counsel admits that the company did contact employer but says that conal not in a position to complain that the firm came to about his dispute with the heart of the i think whether or not conal mentioned his employer is beside the the problem should not have reached the point where he was even reaching out the comcast had the billing issues been fixed on the first second third fourth fifth or sixth chance that he gave comcast to address the issue the call in question would never have and even if conal did identify his employer in the hope of getting his billing issue fixed he have been trying to get preferential just the service paid also curious why even though comcast insists that conal attempted to leverage his place of business to get his issue resolved it has not specifically cited language that he allegedly used in the how many times a day do comcast reps hear a customer say something like a or a big shot at in the how many of those result in comcast going out of its way to contact that we reached out to comcast to ask whether company policy to contact no one answered that question but a rep for comcast did give a brief customers deserve the best experience every time they interact with reads the comcast says it has previously apologized to conal but adds will review his letter and respond as quickly as

879,taibbi is taking a of from pierre first look according to new york the move comes disagreements with inside a source close to first look confirmed over the last year however the center of gravity of the organization has shifted as omidyar and his silicon valley braintrust have exerted control over budgets and vacillated over the journalistic over the summer omidyar appointed a longtime confidante john temple a former newspaper editor who previously led an civic journalism venture in hawaii to be the president for audience and products putting him in a position above eric bates the former rolling stone editor who was brought on as a first look editorial director who is close to the of also comes three months after i first reported that omidyar had apparently ordered taibbi to change his strategy away from purely covering corporate fatcats uh pierre to a wider mission involving more comedy than around the same time i heard rumors that eric bates was also unhappy at the previously had spirited email conversation with taibbi about both claims although taibbi would only engage on the condition that his words were for a strange demand coming from an editor at a site about leaking confidential i emailed taibbi again today to ask if i can publish his responses in the light of he you may here then for what little worth is my side of the correspondence from back in july in which i laid out the state of first look as i saw it a little help from some well placed the discussion spirited on both all words below are mine just have to try to infer what stated position might have a note on not for publication off the i thought carefully about the ethics of publishing even my half of a for given first own policy of publishing confidential documents and the fact that it seems clear taibbi being entirely truthful about his place at the company i ultimately came down on the side of publishing my own responses with words sure some readers with disagree i welcome the also an important taibbi previously worked with mark ames on russian newspaper the it has been widely reported that the two are no longer on speaking i discuss this post with mark before ok here are the email thread began with emailing me to deny that omidyar had changed his i had emailed first look for comment on my story before publication but received no email was headed for paul carr matt taibbi tue jul 29 2014 taibbi quote denying my right but not the part that seems to have changed is that description of the site yesterday made zero mention of wall gone from finance first to politics more broadly and happy to stay off the record clearly something weird going on over why does a 250m journalism project have to shift focus before it suggests po has no clue how to handle talent and so is retreating back to responded with questions of his my paul carr matt taibbi tue jul 29 2014 i think took you aside and ordered you not to cover his i think either you made the decision yourself for reasons of an easier life or his blog post was the first you heard about the change and he just publicly fucked you knowing what i do about his management style leaning towards the but i emailed you because i actually want to understand going responded and i replied paul carr matt taibbi tue jul 29 2014 if i waited for pierre and his staffers to respond to questions never publish a thing about first given po 48hrs to respond before and still got sure always held stories indefinitely until you receive a as for your bizarre chain of straw man arguments i say hired you to shut you so no i something you just made as you say that would be real what i i think pierre has any idea why he hired you and i think entirely sure perhaps he was looking for names that looked good on a press release and you fit the i think tired and i think you knew the rolling stone gig going to last for i think po offered you complete editorial freedom and promised you a blank check to build your own for that reason i think announcement yesterday should be terrifying to you and to anyone else who works at lost his nerve for a combination of reasons and is retreating to something he technology and spoken to people who have known omidyar for decades and people who have worked with him on previous publications if you seriously think going to have your back when you go after his pals more naive well than you tired of this conversation i honestly tell if being a team player or if you believe any of this sure continue to cover flm and continue to ask for comment when i entirely up to you if you respond before publication or wait until afterwards and then bitch on either way continue to read your wall st stuff you publish it just as i read and enjoyed your most recent book on a long flight a few weeks best of luck responded paul carr matt taibbi wed jul 30 2014 tired of it because you refuse to actually engage in laid out my position clearly and honestly and asked follow up you actually address any of my points you just keep lobbing back straw men and not engaging with what at the very least turned into a corporate flack for first continuing to hammer away at a caricatured version of what i said while refusing to answer questions and demanding that the whole thing stay off the record so that readers continue to be left in the the last person who tried that line of attack over a pando story was lanny told you what i believe but humor you and your enjoyment at playing pr flack by saying it again this time line by taibbi i think unlikely pierre you to stop writing about wall say the odds almost not that fucking what i said of course i think he took you aside and ordered you not to cover his i think either you made the decision yourself for reasons of an easier life or his blog post was the first you heard about the change and he just publicly fucked you my question which you seem keen to did you know pierre was going to leave finance out of his post about what your editorial mission would if not that worry if so what is the reasoning behind not mentioning the thing that you are best known for but which is likely to make your sole funder and boss the most a what are we to make of the fact that first look journalists greenwald in particular insist that pierre has no control over editorial insisted similar in this and yet the one laying out the editorial why that be the job of the actual instead we have your funder issuing a statement that marginalizes the one aspect of your work that might sting him while reassuring the world that he intends to permit you and greenwald to continue doing your jobs but that he has decided to axe plans for all the other editorial sites he previously a video starring said he would what does the phrase actually mean at first taibbi i think what he told you when you were first hired people are told lots of things on first taibbi never said a total red taibbi i mention anything in my story about pierre ordering you to stop writing as made clear i believe that would make any i mention what i suspect you might have been told when you were hired again i what i know and what i wrote is that the public statements about your mission have i mention it being a satirical publication because that taibbi a press release about what your job and focus will be written by the man who writes your pay checks and who is backing down on almost all of the editorial strategy that was in place when you were a press release that was at odds with all previous statements about what your focus will specifically leaving out the one thing that would seem to have the potential to make omidyar most yes i believe that means you will be focussing far less on that aspect of things and yes i believe that either a choice consciously made or a choice pierre is attempting to make for you through passive aggressive public your choice of denial is the same line greenwald used when he was challenged on whether he would write about business clear enough to sound like a denial but general enough to allow you to focus most of your energies away from wall do you at least concede that previously the chief focus of your site was to be on finance and now on politics and if the of the site still on uncovering financial yes or if yes why did your boss mischaracterize the site so badly in his blog post and if no why taibbi pierre has been interfering with first editorial plans from the every single editorial plan first look has exists only at he is your sole funder and he is the one making public statements about how he intends to allocate those how is it possible you understand wall street so well but understand taibbi yes that is apparent from taibbi i had plenty of information and printed what i knew after giving you the opportunity to respond before have plenty more information to set the record straight if answer any of the questions or better still stop hiding behind for why if being so unfairly maligned you let any of the above be shared with the whole basis of first look to make all the information public and let readers why that apply to conversations about first look and its billionaire which leads me to my last have you or any first look staffer to the best of your knowledge signed an nda or non disparagement contract either as a standalone or as part of your employment right this is an enjoyable now shift it up a gear and get to some real despite previously saying he was enjoying our conversation taibbi stopped responding when i asked him he had signed any kind of contract restricting his freedom to talk openly about first when i emailed him earlier today i asked if he had anything to add to his previous he that your story was wrong then and still

964,in besieged syrian town reports arrival of patients with burning eyes and breathing difficulties after kurds battling islamic state militants for control of kobani fear the extremist group may have used an unidentified chemical weapon according to officials and one of the few doctors still working in the besieged syrian patients with blisters burning eyes and breathing difficulties turned up at a clinic after a blast was heard on tuesday evening dr walat omar he described the symptoms as abnormal and said he could not identify their cause but suspected a chemical a loud explosion tuesday we received some patients with abnormal they reported a bad smell which produced some kind of allergic omar said in a telephone interview that was periodically disrupted by heavy had red patches and blisters on their skins others had difficulties breathing and others were vomiting with painful throats and others with burning eyes and there was one patient all his body was covered in red patches and islamic state is thought to have obtained stocks of ageing but still potent chemical weapons when it seized iraqi army bases where they were stored the new york times reported earlier this in june the group took control of a sprawling complex that had been the heart of saddam chemical weapons programme state there may also have been chemical weapons buried or abandoned elsewhere that were not destroyed by us forces or the iraqi stocks manufactured before 1991 are dirty corroded and not always easy to identify or use but can still cause serious iraqi officials said 11 police officers were poisoned by chlorine gas last month when isis fighters used it to attack the iraqi town of all the officers that attack was hundreds of miles from kobani near the syrian border where

chemical weapons but omar said they displayed symptoms distinct from anything else he had treated in weeks of heavy he said he had ruled out chlorine gas or biological weapons based on his medical

young man with large skin blisters and a severely swollen the pictures did not have any metadata to confirm the time and place they were taken but had not been published on the internet before omar provided them to a kurdish one expert with personal experience of treating mustard gas victims said that although the blisters were not typical the symptoms overall were consistent with a possible sulphur mustard that could only be confirmed with a urine or blood other experts said that while the symptoms could be consistent with exposure to a chemical agent they were somewhat unusual and other medical conditions such as a severe allergic reaction would need to be ruled senior kurdish politicians said they feared a chemical attack and had asked for testing kits to seek people were injured and showed symptoms of chemical weapons choking breathing difficulties bleeding eyes burning skin said idris nassan deputy foreign minister of the kobani of the doctors say that it might be phosphorus or poison gas of some kind but the investigation is ongoing we know for it is possible that isis fighters could mistake some chemical munitions for ordinary weapons and use them without being aware of what they are it could also be harder to evaluate the impact of attacks using partially degraded weapons one expert factors might contribute to far milder symptoms than those normally associated with mustard agent exposure under combat these could include impure or degraded agent exposure or exposure to a limited volume of said zanders a former analyst with the chemical and biological warfare project at the stockholm international peace research the bomb believed to have caused the injuries treated by omar exploded at about 10pm in west kobani near a omar said he thought isis may have

civil war then appears in the the masked executioner speaking in english with what sounds like a british accent identifies sotloff and says that life of this american citizen obama depends on your next intelligence officials said they were still evaluating the video and could not immediately authenticate a white house statement said have seen a video that purports to be the murder of citizen james foley by one of several acronyms associated with the intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its said the statement by national security council spokeswoman caitlin genuine we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent american journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and we will provide more information when it is president obama was briefed on the video aboard air force one as he returned to his vineyard vacation and will be updated on further developments the white house true the murder of james foley is shocking and british prime minister david cameron said on his office said wednesday he was cutting short a family vacation and returning to london to chair emergency meetings on iraq and in an interview with the bbc foreign secretary philip hammond acknowledged that the apparent executioner spoke with a british accent and said the video seemed to be hundreds of britons are believed to have traveled to syria to fight in the civil war including many who have joined the islamic absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of british nationals involved in terrible crimes probably in the commission of hammond of these people may seek at some point to return to the and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic a european intelligence official said the british government was examining the video and the speech of the purported executioner to compare it with former guantanamo bay prisoners and other british residents believed to have joined the islamic both prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the military prison at guantanamo bay a similar outfit believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison was worn by

1123,very first nonsense i had to debunk in 2014 was a claim that on 4 of that year a planetary alignment would cause gravity to allowing you to float momentarily or fall more slowly if you jumped in the air at the right g this exact same hoax has resurfaced this week in a couple of so decided to update the debunking to include some new links and repost hopefully to stem the tide of silliness at it seems fitting that this is also the last debunking make in but who still a week something never hear me now heard it long experience has taught me there is always a sillier and hearing that from a guy who has debunked the ideas that the maya calendar predicted the end of the world that the caused earthquakes and that a magnetic pole flip of the earth will cause superstorms another saying the earth is already physically starting to flip so sillier than well we now have the claim that early next 4 2015 at pst to be to the combined gravity of jupiter and pluto you will be able to jump in the air and float for just a couple of seconds at least fall more slowly depending on different hard for me to overstate just how wrong this claim first off this exact same hoax was pulled last year in 2014 by a site called news hound offline and a lot of people fell for here we are again a year later back at the same this time the joke is being made by a site called daily buzz live even bother to change much of the wording of the original they even have a picture of a nasa tweet about the only one that picture is completely nasa never tweeted it and it was presumably made up wholesale for the article on daily buzz whoever did it was clever adding the number of retweets and favorites but as fake as a iphone you can buy on the street in new york after all the physics of g is wrong the claim about pluto and jupiter is wrong this part is the real based on a joke made by an astronomer nearly 40 years despite this spreading around facebook so much once again that i got a lot of people asking or telling me about why debunking this thing so to get started the it has been revealed by the british astronomer patrick moore that on the morning of january 4th 2014 an extraordinary astronomical event will at exactly am the planet pluto will pass directly behind jupiter in relation to the this rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull temporarily counteracting the own gravity and making people weigh moore calls this the gravitational yeah except this is all to be ok so why is this pluto and jupiter sitting in a tree first of all the gravitational forces of the other planets in the solar system have essentially zero effect on you and full ok fine give some brief the planets are big objects with lots of gravity but that only affects you if close to space however is why we call it planets are far this weakens their gravity on you hugely reducing it to less than the impact of the flutter of a if you want the math then here you even if you add all of the planets together they pull on you with a force less than 2 percent of that of the the daily buzz live article mentions tides too but even the combined tidal force from the planets is far less like percent of the simply put the planets are just too far away to have any real effect on by the way the moon orbits the earth on an ellipse so its own gravity fluctuates far more than the combined strength of the planets every two note that you cannot float in the air every two and specifically the gravity from pluto is weakest of them pluto is a teeny tiny ice ball far smaller than even our moon and at its closest 4 billion kilometers billion from a long a car on the road half a kilometer away has more gravitational pull on you than pluto in fact doing the math i find that the earth pulls on you about 200 trillion times harder than pluto about the same ratio as the number of cells in your body to a single cell so this claim that you can float is like saying you can shed a single cell and fly away by flapping your it gets worse the article says pluto will be behind on 4 i on that day they are on nearly opposite sides of the really far apart about you have picked a much worse date to claim pluto was behind so the physics of the claim is but the origin of the claims makes it even fool me once shame on the article on daily buzz live mentions that this claim came from patrick he was a real astronomer in the an enormously popular radio and television science program predated carl sagan and is still considered an icon of science in the wonderful thing about all this moore actually did make this however as points out it was an april day moore made this claim in 1976 on his radio to my complete unsurprise apparently some folks called in to say they did feel the this is called where you tell people in advance that feel something due to some cause and they will even if the cause never used by ghost hunters and ghost tour guides quite a bit to spook people before they actually enter a guaranteeing feel chills as they walk from room to seen this myself first people can convince themselves of amazing things that never actually hope so there you a repeat of a silly claim based on a joke in the first i know a lot of people reading this right now are slapping their foreheads and wondering how people can be so stupid as to fall for i understand this reaction but i share smart people fall for silly things all the time and intelligence really the prime factor skepticism in general schools teach people how to analyze a claim how to tell if something makes sense on the surface of it or how to go about looking into the i knew right away to do the math and to see if pluto and jupiter really were aligned as the article but all too often people think carefully at about these claims and simply spread them through social all it takes is literally the click of a pseudoscience thrives via this virulence whereas truth must take a harder in fact why i bother debunking stuff like sure this is a silly claim and probably harmless in but not all of them i already mentioned the from 2012 and i can tick off a dozen other doomsday or scary claims that spread due to a lack of and of course there are real issues like global warming denial and more which live and breathe and spread due to a lack of skepticism in the in my original post about this in january 2014 i said particular bit of fluff will dry up and float away in a day or two but those others are here to stay for a long i was wrong and i known that something like this would resurface again in a like the as big as the nonsense that comes back year after still my hope is that every time we take a moment to inject a bit of skepticism into everyday lives it makes the world a slightly better place to if enough of us do it often enough we can change to

1210,it third law of apple for every extreme reaction one there is an equally extreme reaction the in this case what that means is that while some doomsayers are happy to write off the apple watch as the worst thing apple has done since building its own smartphone taking on the music industry with itunes actual bad others go in totally the opposite direction and predict a landslide victory in trip chowdhry of global equities research falls somewhat into the latter his that the apple watch will have 100000 apps ready to go when it launches in april and that 42 million units will have sold by the end of claim about 100000 apps is based on his attending six apple hackathons over past few although i doubt that there will be plenty of apps ready to go on the day be frankly shocked if close to that by comparison it took the ios app store 16 months to hit 100000 apps by which point it had seen approximately 2000000000 total his 42 million prediction is a bit closer to the mark and in line with other reports pegging sales as likely to fall between million units in its first year on the while 42 million would be a fraction of the number of units apple sells of the iphone it would still be enough to make it the runaway fastest selling new ios device in the ipad by comparison sold million units in its first year while the iphone moved a relatively paltry million chowdry thinks that the apple watch will then go on to convert virtually every existing iphone user apple watch extends iphone functionality and provides user convenience with and to an iphone user almost every current iphone user which are about 350 million users will also be an apple watch chowdry also gives us a neat way of explaining away the fact that we spent upwards of on an apple watch to our price of apple watch appears to be a he writes since an average an apple watch user will have 100 apps installed and one way to think about it is that the consumer is getting 100 devices for per finally he argues that we think about a for the apple watch people have different killer applications for their for some it is the games for others it is the social messaging or it is the navigation or it is the music or it is video or it is email so on and so debating on is the killer app for the is somewhat of thinking when the killer app used to be thinking of apple watch from the watch perspective is also fundamentally the best watch on the market is probably a 3 app device it tells time may be day tuesday it may also have a stop by april 10 2015 we are expecting 100000 apple watch apps on currently on an average there are 65 apps per we are estimating that an average apple watch will have 100 apps per apple there will be no single killer app for apple watch each user will have their own set of killer apps one way to think is that the consumer is getting 100 different devices in one apple this last point i can absolutely agree the notion of a as visicalc was to the apple ii for instance is outdated to be the kind of mass market device it needs to be the apple watch will have to be all things to all people which is essentially what the iphone currently manages to have to wait a bit longer to see if figures hold water but no doubting his and at a time when apple can seemingly do no wrong who can entirely blame

during the christmas aside from the obvious problem is that this would be an unbelievable nightmare for us poor souls in the this seems to be a case of a reasonable article by boy genius report written back in august being rehashed and misinterpreted this for a start bgr wrote that the next macbook air would be ready in time for the christmas holidays not launched during them during the holidays would be a truly bizarre move denying the products access to the lucrative shopping that nuance seems to have been lost in and beyond this the article was as we said written in august at which point a launch still seemed now pretty much certain that the retina macbook air will have to wait until update 7 jan sure enough no macbook air appeared over the very the latest rumour suggests instead that a radically 12in macbook air will launch in perhaps making an appearance at wwdc see more details and images in the design section been awaiting the launch of a new macbook air for some

review and macbook air 2014 13in what people are really waiting for is a new macbook air with broadwell processor and a retina the new macbook air line up is said to include a completely new model which may replace the version giving customers the option of a slighly bigger screen or it may replace the model where customers could instead opt for the comparitively priced macbook pro with retina so when will this new macbook air reports in mid june suggested that apple would begin production of this macbook air in the third according to a digitimes report quanta computer was set to begin production of the new macbook air in this may have started if the new intel chips arrived in they may intel has issued a press release regarding the arrival of its new core m chip that some believe could be used in the new macbook a number of manufacturers are already said to be using this new chip in their laptops and tablets and some of these models will be available in according to intel acer asus dell hp lenovo and toshiba are all using the core if this new intel chip is used by apple reports suggest that the new retina macbook air will be available in time for in an august report on digitimes the site claimed that its sources in the taiwanese supply chain said that the production of components for the new macbook had begun and that it may launch before the end of this year or next however there are also reports that suggest the new retina macbook air could be delayed until next year it may not be using these core m chips relying instead on a different series of intel core i5 broadwell processors on that one report even suggests a launch date claiming that the date has already been pushed back on multiple read our new retina imac release date new retina macbook air rumours redesign new colours thinner on 6 january 2015 9to5mac posted a series of images that it says show the next macbook radical new new 12in macbook air design mockups by bear in mind that these are renders rather than photos of the real thing sure agree that extremely well done the artist is michael 9to5mac commissioned the images based on information it acquired from sources within apple have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming it entirely clear how much of the design comes from the sources and how much from the imagination although many of the most major changes the keyboard layout for are obviously in the former sure enough the new design is for a laptop with a new screen 12 yet the slimming process in these designs is so extreme that the new 12in macbook air actually has a smaller body than the existing 11in macbook the screen is a little bigger but everything around the screen has been here to the renders at any is how the new 12in macbook air will compare to the current 11in macbook air new 12in macbook air design mockups by this also partly illustrates the biggest bombshell in these the new design finds space for only one port on each side of the it has a usb port on the righthand edge new smaller and reversible and a headphone socket along with a couple of microphone holes on the if this is right the macbook will have to be powered via the usb port and sure enough usb will be perfectly adequate for that it just means that you be able to use a usb hard drive wired mouse wireless mouse or other usb accessory while the macbook is plugged macworld contributor kirk mcelhearn is one of the sceptics who have pointed out the numerous inconveniences this would impose and possible likely we would say that the eventual layout will be less we think the magsafe power connection is likely to as we mentioned briefly the keyboard is also designed the power button now sits next to the esc key at the corner of the keyboard and the keys have in general been shrunk down and squeezed the trackpad on the other hand has been expanded and now comes closer to the new 12in macbook air design mockups by of course images the first apparent leak about the next macbook jack marsh a blogger who appears to have a source with plausible information about the new macbook air seems to have become the the blogger for all macbook air there have certainly been other young bloggers who have gained insight into unannounced apple products but as yet we be sure the claims are marsh has a rumour about the macbook air to add to an earlier rumour that suggested the new model would come in gold silver and space grey finishes on that now he claims his source has told him that the new design is so thin apple has had to switch to a new reversible usb type c connector which is significantly smaller than usb 3 apparently the magsafe port is also getting a redesign for the same the laptop chassis is too thin to accomodate the current magsafe indeed the macbook air may charge in an entirely new way although source clear on whether this had been finalised the macbook air is also said to feature thin bezels with a keyboard that stretches to the edge of the marsh also claims his source told display bezels are noticeably thinner quite similar to the current macbook pro retina earlier report claimed that the new macbook air will come in space grey and gold finishes as well as the usual macrumors lent some credibility to this inisial report claiming that they are aware that has at least considered launching the 12in notebook with several different colour and it be the first time apple has introduced a range of colour choices on their mac new retina macbook air many of the new macbook air rumours suggest this model will feature a 12in some sources point to evidence that apple is working with 12in screens but there have been claims that quanta computer will be building a rumoured ipad later this year and it could be the ipad pro that is being referred to according to a digitimes report in june sources claim apple wishes to introduce a smaller macbook air to make clearer the distinction between the macbook air and the ipad air with its canalys analyst daniel matte also believes apple is working on a new version of the macbook air one with a other rumours place the screen size at 12in probably matches in his blog matte seems to be suggesting that there may only be one macbook air this new model with the model being phased out in favour of the macbook pro with retina kgi securities analyst kuo suggested back in october 2013 that apple will launch a macbook air in kuo suggested that this new macbook air would have an entirely new the smaller 12in model could still accommodate a reasonably sized screen and keyboard if it had a smaller new retina macbook air fanless the new macbook air is also said to be even thinner than the existing macbook this is based on the theory that it will use new intel core m processor a chip that need by using this processor it is claimed that apple could make the laptop 9mm the macbook air is currently thick so it could be almost 1cm thinner at its thickest apparently the fan assembly is the reason why the macbook air is thicker at one end than the removing the fan assembly would enable apple to make the laptop thinner than ever according to presumably there will be some sort of cooling system built in but that may not be the new intel processors are said to be efficient enough to make the removal of the fan feasible indeed there are already laptops on the market that do not feature a even the core m may still require cooling in a 12in laptop the new broadwell processor should enable a fanless design for the smaller to laptop or mobile device notes motley fool based on what intel said at its developer forum in it has been suggested that the macbook air could also offer thermal scaling and thermal another advantage of a fanless design would be quiet there would also be no moving parts it less likely to and it could also offer higher battery capacity because the remaining space could be used to house a bigger help but worry that history could repeat itself if the macbook air is fan free steve jobs famously refused to include a fan in the apple iii leading to hardware new retina macbook air usb type if source is correct the new macbook air may offer usb type c support which is smaller than usb 3 usb type c is able to support 10gbps data transfers which is twice as fast as usb 3 but still slower than thunderbolt 2 the same as the older thunderbolt it will also support for up to 100 watts of power which is apparently enough to power 4k displays as thunderbolt cable does the only problem is that usb type c new retina macbook air inductive source also claims that the magsafe port may get a redesign and that the macbook air may charge in an entirely new perhaps the new macbook air will use inductive charging like the apple watch new retina macbook air trackpad according to a report on chinese site weiphone earlier this year the new macbook air will be thinner and lighter a feat it will achieve by removing the fan and the clicking mechanism in the the new 12in model will drop the trackpad and introduce and optical and new touch gestures according to this report from ben latest new retina macbook air retina will the next macbook air feature a retina one of the strongest and most persistent rumours and certainly apple may opt to keep prices down battery life by keeping the screen but we think according to our own reviews of the macbook air the macbook air is currently let down by its display which has a lower resolution than the canalys analyst daniel matte has written a blog claiming that apple will add a retina display to the macbook air this he expects that we will see a model with a resolution of 2732x1536 pixels the same 264ppi that the ipad air he explains the significance of apple using the same display technology for the macbook air and ipad air turns out that an retina macbook air with a 2732 x 1536 resolution happens to have the exact same pixel density as the 2048 x 1536 retina it would make sense for apple to take advantage of the same display technology it has been utilizing for the ipads by cutting their panels to this larger rumours also claim that the new macbook air retina display could have a resolution of 2304 x 1440 for a rumoured 12in display 226 pixels per inch compared to 227 pixels per inch for the 13in macbook pro offers this adds up to a aspect ratio like that found on the 13in macbook air and macbook pro models rather than the aspect ratio currently offered by the 11in macbook the current macbook air offers a 1366 x 768 pixel the rumours of a macbook air with retina display have been long back in february 2013 rumours suggested that apple was planning to launch a revamped macbook air with a retina display in the of a separate report in march 2013 also claimed that apple would introduce a retina display to the macbook air in since this happen in 2013 it is perhaps likely for apple does appear to be moving the whole of its range to retina the company updated the retina versions of its macbook pro in 2013 and also introduced a retina ipad mini in october wondering what the retina display fuss is all a retina display and a retina hd apple may use the igzo display technology for the new display offering improved power the reason for the supposition is that apple was recruiting for a engineers with experience in led backlighting and lcd displays in february according to in an lcd display the bunches of pixels with wires running behind to connect the backlight has to shine though this mesh of wires to light up the in an igzo display more light is able to shine though this mesh of wires so the power requirements are lower and battery life can be as a result we could see even longer battery life than the 12 hours currently on offer from the 13in macbook rumours about a retina macbook air with a smaller display have been circulating for some kgi securities analyst kuo suggested back in october 2013 that apple will launch a macbook air in kuo suggested that this new macbook air would have an entirely new then back in january 2014 evercore partners analyst patrick wang predicted that a 12in hybrid would launch in the autumn of it is possible that the rumoured retina display macbook air could be this canalys analyst daniel matte also believes apple will add a retina display to the macbook air this new retina macbook air intel has announced the new intel core m some expect that this processor may be used by apple inside the new macbook as mentioned above because this chip need fans the new macbook air could be less than a centimeter thick at its thickest since it uses the 14nm processor the processor itself it is the core m processor should also enable the new macbook to be more with better battery intel claims the most chip the core m also offers excellent graphics processing power according to intel says it will offer seven times the graphics power of machines and double the graphical and three times the web performance of the current range of however intel has not confirmed that apple will use the new the press release regarding the new chip intel mentions acer asus dell hp lenovo and toshiba as potentially using the core some of these models will be available in october according to the core m is designed for small laptops large tablets and devices and intel is positioning the chips as being for use in laptops of tablets above 10in and dual apple would traditionally use the core i5 chips in its macbook so it is possible that these processors will never appear in a macbook air which may instead use the new u broadwell processor which may not ship until redmond pie reports that performance with the core m been particularly it was featured in the lenovo yogo 3 pro which exactly set the world benchmark speed tests and overall reviews rated the device quite therefore been suggested that apple may give the core m a miss and go instead for an i5 or i7 the other hand some analysts have argued that implementation of the core m rather than the innate qualities of the core m itself was to blame for the performance and that engineers would be able to coax solid performance from a core macbook we shall whichever broadwell processor apple does use it should make the retina display macbook air broadwell is said to consume 30 percent less power than its predecessor haswell and that should be good news for battery life on the portable macs especially those with power hungry other features of the broadwell chip are that it is low power and offers integration with widi 4g wwan and wigig new retina macbook air may not use intel this rumour has been floating around for some it is possible that apple will ditch the intel processor in its range of laptop in favour of its own chips like those found in the ipad and some have even speculated that the new macbook air could mark some sort of crossover between the ipad and the macbook perhaps an ipad however rumours that apple will move from intel to arm chips seem unlikely based on this explaination from cult of new retina macbook air uk with the price of the macbook air and macbook pro with retina display being so close we had expected that apple would reduce the price of the macbook even currently for the 11in model which is less than in this compares to the macbook pro retina starting price of however the fact that the the range iphone 6 plus costs more than the entry level macbook air makes us think that the macbook air price is more likely to it may be that the macbook air is discontinued as that model is similar in price to the macbook pro with retina but not equal in this would leave the cheaper macbook air models with potentially an price of when it first launched in october 2012 the macbook pro with retina display started at this was reduced to a few months later when the range received a processor now with the april 2014 update to the macbook air the price of the model is a much more compelling which makes the difference between the macbook pro with retina display and the macbook air rather than in his predictions last year kgi securities analyst kuo suggested that the price of this new macbook

tiny battery life tweak the main change for the new macbook air models was the each model is now under with prices starting at less than the previous this helps keep the macbook air an attractive option for customers as the previous price was not much different to the price of the new macbook pro with retina the range update came as some surprise as the retina display for the macbook air

macbook air macbook air review why is the retina macbook air if there is a delay the key reason may be the availability of intel processors rather than the production of the new newest generation of chips the successor to the haswell chips currently in the macbook air called broadwell has been plagued by however in a conference call about results on 15 july chief executive brian krzanich confirmed hardware partners will have broadwell systems on store shelves in the run up to he said we would have products on shelves for the holiday season and we continue to work with our partners and on schedule to have product on shelf in the as we mention above some of these new chips are now shipping however anyone awaiting the new retina macbook pro macbook air imac and mac mini should note that there are various broadwell chips being developed by intel and the chips that intel confirmed are shipping now are the m variety destined for fanless the new macbook air may use the u broadwell processor which may not ship until we are sure that apple is pretty frustrated with shipment of skylake the successor to broadwell which will offer even more power than that chip is also new retina macbook air release will the macbook air be an ipad there are also rumours that apple could launch a 12in ipad but this might not arrive until 2015 or the rumours could relate to the 12in there are also rumours that the new macbook air merge with the ipad to create the ipad you can read more about the ipad pro rumours we think that a macbook air that offered a dual boot system for ios 7 and mac os x would be very interesting however tim cook last year ruled out any kind of convergence suggesting that a toaster refrigerator will the old macbook air if apple launches a 12in macbook air will it discontinue the existing possible that if apple launches a 12in retina macbook air model it will discontinue both or either of the existing equally apple could maintain one of the existing models as an it seems more likely that it would keep the 11in model on at an even lower price rather than keep on the bigger 13in one reason why apple may keep a macbook air on is the fact that apple has just introduced a new imac and already the macbook air looks superior to that despite costing if apple wants a low end option it would appear unlekely that the retina macbook air would be read our review of the new imac and see how it compares to the macbook the new macbook air will be ok so this is a bit of an rumour but it really is possible that apple will one day release a new macbook air with a

strategy who spoke on condition of the nypd will issue violation summonses to people caught with marijuana instead of putting them in handcuffs and taking them to a the summonses will require people to appear in court at a later date and pay a few details on the new policy were immediately available but an official with one of the five district attorneys offices confirmed to buzzfeed news on monday that the change the official added that would still be cause for arrest but that having the drug in a public place would the nypd and mayor bill de office did not immediately respond to requests for comment but are expected to officially announce the new policy at a news conference on manhattan district attorney cyrus he supported the change two years ago and still policy by diverting thousands of cases from criminal court will also keep offenders particularly teens from an arrest and all its attendant consequences including a night or more in he the new policy which was first reported by the new york times would bring about a sea change in the way the city is marijuana possession accounts for a large percentage of the arrests a vast majority of which happen to young black or latino men living in poor some public defenders praised the is a huge lisa schreibersdorf executive director of brooklyn defender services told buzzfeed get you this will be better for people who are vulnerable to collateral consequences like still schreibersdorf cautioned that the policy will not fulfill its goal unless the nypd relaxes its identification requirements for immigrants and teenagers often do not carry valid identification she said which often means that they cannot be processed for a she added that the policy does not address the root cause of the problem namely that police officers in new york routinely stop people without probable summonses is an improvement for people who are already being stopped but that mean they should be stopped in the first she problem from my perspective is that stopping people without cause is advocates also warned that the new policy could result in an increased number of arrest warrants which are issued to people who fail to

shabu in this xmas a strange one youtube user questioned choice of a liquor mart a walk away for his food shop as opposed to a nearer supermarket seems like an odd indeed in november 2013 paler lin gave another homeless man and told an actor playing a beggar to approach him to ask for money for again the real beggar handed over some the user with the handle claimed the start of paler recent homeless video which sees the director hand thomas before secretly following him with a camera immediately suggests it may be a why did thomas buy food from a liquor store not a cheaper grocery why did he stop at a shop a walk from the park instead of the shop closest to the if josh paler business is to make videos why did he set out to a homeless person spending on speaking in his own video he said paler lin could not possibly have guaranteed the man was going to pick up his things and spend the money immediately instead of remaining by the did he know he was going to spend the money he had no he he also picked holes in the claim that thomas did not notice the camera nor paler lin has a distinctive following him throughout the duration of his trip to a nearby liquor after shopping at the

his begging spot people see you getting all this traffic they want to bring you when questioned by he did not explain why thomas chose to drag several bags of food 34 minutes to the park instead of shopping at least two stores that were closer to the but he strongly denied staging any of his films or having met thomas before the in homeless video thomas apparently begrudgingly accepts the cash from the beggar then walks into a liquor mart where he purchases food for his beggar friends not the camera following thomas as he hands food to a family in the park he was initially filmed had little expectation maybe he would buy alcohol maybe he he said of the wanted to see what a homeless person would spend it no one has ever done that however the youtube user claimed the number of hits received by paler previous youtube videos between 600000 to 800000 according to a site that tracks youtube channel statistics could have prompted him to construct what he knew would be a viral indeed

it is clear that from what i saw every part of that scene was however thomas has now spoken to fox la insisting that to him it was a and he had never met josh before he was handed the he told the news appreciate it most all a surprise to i thought this was just a project video i had no idea this was going where it thomas people give you a dollar maybe five as a big tip but a hundred wow a paler lin had initially set out to homeless in los angeles by giving them cash in the expectation that they will spend it on however thomas proved to be an instead he spent the money on food to share with his friends prompting paler lin to return and surprise thomas with a christmas meal makeover and a night in a with an skeptics have picked holes in a viral video showing a homeless man spending a donation on food for his beggar friends deeming it a creation that was focused on making the videos that have gained more than 26million views are part of a campaign to raise more than via an indiegogo page for thomas to get his life back on but critics pointed to a number of apparent flaws in the footage as well as the hefty profit paler lin has reportedly made from its success up to a huge youtube

description below so i can get some traffic to my youtube channel but it never now addressing this issue due to a number of youtube pranksters getting exposed for making stage other users have claimed that homeless films are a way of boosting traffic and consequently money via advertisements on the social networking go to a homeless person and make a video because they know going to get said one youtube user referring to the personalities such as paler now viewers have questioned the authenticity citing a number of in the above lin is pictured in a facebook he is for producing videos for

the liqour store because it was closest to his begging spot people see you getting all this traffic they want to bring you when questioned by he did not explain why thomas chose to drag several bags of food 34 minutes to the park instead of shopping at least two stores that were closer to the but he strongly denied staging any of his films or having met thomas before the had little expectation maybe he would buy alcohol maybe he he said of the wanted to see what a homeless person would spend it no one has ever done that the camera following thomas as he hands food to a family in the park he was initially filmed however the youtube user claimed the number of hits received by paler previous youtube videos between 600000 to 800000 according to a site that tracks youtube channel statistics

1594,the story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from news has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near nicaragua late saturday just 13 hours or so before the close flyby of asteroid 2014 leading some to suggest that the two events are according to experts who have been examining the including those at the two events are completely and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from according to the nicaraguan news site an explosion occurred around saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over 12 metres wide and about metres deep in a wooded area just to the west of the international airport and just south of the the video below from shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the while the incident is still being investigated officials with institute of territorial studies which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the seismic are convinced that this was a we have seen the crater from the wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence can see two first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the however while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just add a wide asteroid named 2014 rc passed by earth on sunday flying underneath the planet the perspective of someone in the northern and while there is roughly a difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these not entirely unreasonable to suggest there are over 11000 known asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we detected likely because too while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting some are best described as which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a shape by their mutual others can be travelling along in with some members preceding or lagging behind the possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some so if one of these asteroid is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the however just because two events an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact happen close to one another mean that they are we saw this back in 2013 when we were watching asteroid 2012 da14 sweep by earth and suddenly a wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just according to jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appears to be the case for this a meteorite without the an interesting fact about this supposed is that although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast around 17 kilometres per second or over 60000 that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide an exceptionally large and bright some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass given the weather over managua on saturday night clouds and calm it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky especially when it happened near a city of over 2 million according to the associated press strauch said it was strange that no one reported a streak of we have to ask if anyone has a photo or was it something this lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the while nearly all meteorites go through a phase during the final part of their journey to surface after it has slowed down enough that it compressing the air enough to cause it to glow their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere some 20 to 30 kilometres above the ground making them visible far and wide across the geoff nodkin professional meteorite hunter and host of science meteorite men tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being notkin further commented that if it was he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic booms during the dark flight and then the he also said that to produce a crater like the one seen it would have to be an iron meteorite as they are the densest and formed the majority of known meteorite craters on in an interview with national geographic donald yeomans the author of finding them before they find us was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite so what was this if it a one very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion as there are still thousandsin cas buried throughout the country remnants of the war fought there in the while this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day as tons of material is swept up by earth as the planet orbits the many of these are missed because they occur during the day or over regions of the planet that heavily some countries have camera networks to capture these events with data being reported on sites like and the university of western ontario as an example there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in managua but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the atlantic ocean over eastern spain as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video what appears to be a second object that may be a piece breaking off the primary

1692,verified that the recording is what it claims to but with competition for this story among the media so go figure that choose to put it on the air and worry about authenticity as of last the fbi was between the ip and the fact that the video file is presumably i assume be able to verify or debunk it it could be a prank the man who recorded it seems to a video chat while it happened but what caught saying is if you were going to prank cnn by getting them to air something sexually explicit in the name of reporting be more explicit than if authentic it tells us how many shots were the attorney tells don lemon she hears 11 i hear a forensic examiner who listened to the tape told cnn he heard least six shots followed by a pause followed by four the autopsy report from the forensic pathologist claims brown was hit at least six times all from the that means that he was hit at least twice in the first flurry of six shots heard here and furthermore that he was facing wilson at some point during that bizarre to me that brown would have turned back to face a man who was still in the process of firing at him at fairly close range but i know what other conclusion can be drawn based on what we the fact that brown had apparently been wounded before the fateful pause during which he either rushed wilson or tried to surrender is also the prosecution will argue that wilson having already drawn blood should have realized that a weakened brown was no longer as much of a physical wilson will argue that he felt threatened precisely because brown allegedly kept coming after he was a man strong enough to take two shots and angry enough about it to advance on a cop with a gun was lethally dangerous how friend dorian johnson described what happened to now in line with the side door they could see the they heard him say something to the effect of you at the same time johnson says the officer attempted to thrust his door open but the door slammed into brown and bounced johnson says the officer with his left hand grabbed brown by the at that moment johnson says he fixed his gaze on the officer to see if he was pulling a stun gun or a real when he saw the muzzle of the seen the barrel of the gun pointed at my he had it pointed at him and said one more a second later johnson said he heard the first shot go johnson says he was within reach of both brown and the he looked over at brown and saw blood pooling through his shirt on the right side of the whole time was holding my friend until the gun went johnson brown and johnson took off running there were three cars lined up along the side of the johnson says he ducked behind the first car whose two passengers were crouching down a bit he watched brown run running he said brown then brown yelled it a second those would be the last words friend would ever say to brown made it past the third then the officer took his second shot striking brown in the at that point johnson says brown stopped turned with his hands up and said have a gun stop according to johnson then the first shot to hit brown was fired while wilson was still sitting in the squad car struggling with him which at least would explain how brown was hit from the front during the first brown then managed to run three car lengths before wilson presumably still inside the car fired his second shot hitting brown in the we know from the autopsy report that the last detail is after listening to this audio the timeline on the first part seems false virtually no delay between the first and second shots fired certainly not long enough for words to be exchanged between brown and unless the audio here picks up after the first shot was fired unless it begins with actually the second shot fired at brown i know how to square account with what the nyt said about what eyewitnesses have told some of the accounts seem to agree on how the fatal altercation initially with a struggle between the officer darren wilson and the teenager michael officer wilson was inside his patrol car at the time while brown who was unarmed was leaning in through an open many witnesses also agreed on what happened officer firearm went off inside the car brown ran away the officer got out of his car and began firing toward brown and then brown stopped turned around and faced the that seems more likely than wilson squeezing off a bunch of rounds while still inside his but in that case since there must have been a delay of a second or two between the first shot that went off inside the car wilson getting out of the car taking aim at brown and then firing again that delay on the the first six shots are basically exit can anything be discerned from the length of the pause between johnson says brown put his hands up and tried to surrender saying have a gun stop alleged friend josie told dana loesch that brown taunted wilson and then rushed does the length of the pause here rule either of those

a crowd on his way to a meeting with cardinals at the vatican on 21 rns photo by david this image is available for web and print for questions contact sally it was a sparkling moment on a rainy november day and the setting in square only burnished reputation as a kindly the story naturally lit up social media became instant promotional material for vegetarians and animal rights groups and on friday even made it to the front page of the new york only one apparently none of it ever yes a version of that quotation was uttered by a pope but it was said decades ago by paul vi who died in there is no evidence that francis repeated the words during his public audience on 26 as has been widely reported nor was there was a boy mourning his dead so how could such a fable so quickly become taken as part of the answer may be the topic of the talk to the crowd that day which centered on the end times and the transformation of all creation into a and a citing paul in the new testament francis said that is not annihilation of the cosmos and of everything around us but the bringing of all things into the fullness of the trail of digital bread crumbs then appears to lead to an italian news report that extended discussion of a renewed creation to the question of whether animals too will go to day we will see our pets in the eternity of the report quoted paul vi as telling a disconsolate boy years the story was titled somewhat for the pope rule it it clear which pope the writer meant the next day 27 a story in the italian daily corriere della sera by veteran vaticanista gian guido vecchi pushed the headline pope and is open to all vecchi faithfully recounted the talk about a new creation and also cited paul but the headline put those words in mouth and that became the the italian version of the huffington post picked it up next and ran an article quoting francis as saying will go to heaven with the and contending that the pope was quoting paul not pope paul as making that statement to console a boy who lost his story by the way is nowhere in the the urban legend became unstoppable a week later when it was translated into english and picked up by the british press which cited paul as saying that day we will see our animals again in eternity of while it has francis adding the is open to all fueling the meme was the fact that francis was photographed accepting a gift of two donkeys from a company promoting the use of donkey milk for infants allergic to milk and francis said his own mother gave him milk as a social media and other media outlets then picked up the story further conflating the statements and the it became a hot mess of a story that was also sparking another theological debate by a pope who was known for prompting the new york times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets paradise and pope show the new york times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets paradise and pope when the new york times went with the story along with input from ethicists and theologians it became gospel television programs discussed the theological breakthrough news outlets created photo galleries of popes with cute animals and others used it as a jumping off point to discuss what other religions think about animals and the at america magazine the james martin wrote an essay discussing the theological implications of statements and what level of authority they may it was all very interesting and illuminating but based on a a number of factors probably contributed to this journalistic train the story had so much going for francis took his papal name from francis of assisi the patron saint of environmentalism who famously greeted animals as brothers and pope francis is also preparing a major teaching document on the environment and almost since the day he was elected in 2013 he has stressed the christian duty to care for francis also blessed a blind guide dog shortly after he was elected an affecting image that was often used in connection with these latest reports of his concern for moreover the media and the public are so primed for francis to say novel things and disregard staid customs that the story was too good to check it fit with the in most accounts comments were also set against statements by his predecessor benedict xvi who insisted that animals did not have that apparent contrast fit a common narrative pitting the more conservative benedict against the ostensibly liberal that may be true in some areas but probably not when it comes to adding insult to injury the times article cited john paul ii as saying in 1990 that animals have souls and are near to god as men but that too was a misquote as media critic dawn eden explained at the website on the other hand there should have been warnings francis has frowned at the modern tendency to favor pets over people and he has criticized the vast amounts of money spent by wealthy societies on animals even as children go in addition the huge popularity has led to at least one other instance of news reports last year said that francis was sneaking out of the vatican at night to feed the homeless around the pope personally debunked that rumor in an interview last march saying the idea never crossed my and that the pope to be a sort of superman a type of star seems offensive to maybe have to give another interview to deflate this latest story and to offer his real thoughts on pets and kre end

1965,proliferation of online news outlets has democratized but also updated the famous adage that a sucker born every for the internet and no circus attracts the suckers quite like the not only will people believe anything about their editors will let them write and as we learned pretty much every year someone will fall for the impossibly preposterous accusation known as the there are moments when biased coverage of israel goes beyond mere last year the good folks at vox a notoriously site declared the existence of a bridge connecting the west bank and it was not a maddening it was rather kind of it was adorable in its own but that such a bridge does not exist is an easily verifiable same goes for new york times jerusalem bureau chief jodi claim in 2012 that prospective jewish construction in the west bank would bisect the west bank and make physical contiguity as was subsequently pointed out corrected this was not even close to being true and rudoren would have known as much had she glanced at a and this week we were treated to another version of this story though one we hear often a bit of a hazing the palestinians find someone they yet sold this particular lie to and watch the magic the lie is that flooding in gaza was caused by israel opening dams in the easily the most important part of this story is the fact that there are no such they are the bank bridge of this and yet the story just keeps appearing because the palestinians never run out of western one of the suckers this year was vice to try to hide its ignorance vice offered up several paragraphs of false accusations from the palestinians followed by this attempt at officials categorically denied they were to blame while speaking to vice news on other outlets were more honest and ethical in the aftermath of publishing the flood as honestreporting notes the daily mail went with a bit of false balance but also crucially added a straight correction and admission of earlier version of this article stated that israel had opened river dams in the south of the country causing flooding in the gaza in fact there are no dams in southern israel and the flooding was caused by rain and drainage we are happy to clarify according to honestreporting the daily mail piece also contained the following amazing flooding was today compounded after an israeli power company cut electricity to two of major west bank and according to camera both agence france presse and al jazeera i passed along the flood afp pulled its video and al jazeera went the vice route by pretending the existence of magical dams is somehow in the flood libel is proof that sometimes people refuse to learn from see this post from jonathan tobin in december 2013 for a reminder that the flood libel is neither new nor idf spokeswoman libby weiss understandably would rather news organizations first locate their unicorns before blaming those unicorns for goring the so why does this keep part of the frustration with reporters stems from their absolute the internet has put so much information within reach and yet reporters are taught that when it comes to israel the facts are and because the facts favor if you were to draw a map of israel using western news reporting have one that showed israel bisecting the west bank while connecting it to gaza via a bridge and holding parliamentary meetings in its capital of tel none of that is true but the picture that emerges from the there also appears to be a kind of modified stockholm syndrome at these reporters and the outlets they represent are constantly made to look like fools by palestinian but they also seem not to mind because they sympathize so strongly with what the propagandists and terrorists are telling if what describing to you sounds an awful lot like an activist not a journalist about and such activists play a key role in disseminating grist for the the first headline is the one that makes waves especially in the arab world and in if the is not a full retraction or correction but rather a piece in which israel is permitted to deny the existence of things that plainly exist then it casts the israeli government as a powerful entity engaged in a it would be bad enough if we were forced to admit that our media just get the story but the truth is much of the time our media just get it and why the flood libel returns year after

to i had made even more than million on the simulated at this point the pr reps jumped in with law order style a conference outside the room back into the room came all i can say is for the simulated trades i was very the returns were incredible and outperformed the damir tell me where you fit into damir well i got excited by this whole trading thing and i said hey let me get on i heard about this article coming out and mohammed invited me and i met but you guys are pals outside of we go to social gatherings and are you into stockpicking as i been into it but mohammed from queens and you go to this elite public high is this a hobby of your parents as well or would you be the first person in your family to pursue high mohammed in my immediate family just so what did your parents think when reading that got mohammed honestly my dad wanted to disown my mom basically said never talk to their morals are that if i lie about it and own up to it then they can no longer trust they knew it was false and they basically wanted to kill me and i spoken to them you where did you sleep last mohammed at a but we damir we stayed awake all been checking out news all over the are your friends blowing up your damir he had 297 unread messages and 190 all the friends shared mohammed it was hyped up beyond damir we were at why dressed but we were there and literally in the building stressing we had 20

did something where i can no longer gain their i have one sister two years younger and we really so there was no million no not even one the story is already coming unglued as the commenters on new site hammer the reporter for even thinking this was new york has now altered its headline to back away from the million figure but the story itself even if this kid had somehow started with as a high school freshman on day one at stuy high have needed to average a compounded annualized return of something like over the three years not hard to see why the story was tough to resist for new york which placed alleged acumen at 12 in its 10th annual to love new pressler quoted him saying not just about we want to create a like all of us who are connected who are in something together who have influence like the koch brothers yep nothing says search engine like no one asked for my opinion but going to provide it anyway having sat with these kids for a good bit on a tough they got carried not but not quite adults either and at least islam was literally quaking as we so yeah they probably should have known but new york and the new york post probably should have as this story smelled fishy the instant it appeared and a quick dance with the calculator probably would have saved these young a couple the stuyvesant high school classmates stayed up all night as the crisis the

2125,december a site called published a piece under the sensational seven primary school students pregnant after presumably refers to according to the article the ministry run by national coordinator for reproductive health nenad babici is the only source the article uses for the the original article has now been linked by the new york post the london daily mail the new york daily news courier mail newser cosmopolitan uk and several none have performed any to confirm the original one newspaper though added details to the story that were never but getting ahead of start with the underlying original even in bosnia such a culturally incendiary story should have resulted in local politicians and jumping in front of a camera and copious of the front none of this is the only source referenced at all in the story is babici and his claim that it but notably he is not quoted as saying it happened he is the remainder of the article does include a direct quote from him but the quote refer to the it instead pushes what is likely a top agenda of his ministry which is that teenage sexual activity can have other health consequences and that curbing teen sex is the responsibility of both the parent and the national coordinator for reproductive health of the republika srpska nenad babici said that children engage in sexual relations as early as at age of 13 or 14 and added that primary school students from a small town in bosnia and herzegovina went to a trip and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on he said that the reason for this was neglect of parents but also educational institutions toward the education of babic said that early engagement in sexual relations later leads to a series of consequences such as infertility various diseases miscarriages and premature the republika srpska between 15 to 18 percent of people are struggling with infertility we have 15 percent of miscarriages and between 5 to 10 percent premature he only last year according to the clinical center of the university in sarajevo 31 minors gave birth four of them are 15 years old ten are 16 years old and 17 are 17 years look at that last if a city the size of sarajevo only recorded 31 instances of teenage births last year then sarajevo have a teen pregnancy problem unless the rate of teen pregnancies that are aborted is meanwhile this story claims the girls were visiting sarajevo from small town in bosnia and called banja it is not at all clear as to what population that is drawn beyond the shortcomings of the article itself how likely is the statistics on the percentages of unprotected sexual encounters that result in pregnancy are not wonderful for obvious this study referenced in this bbc article puts the figure at about 5 percent except for the short window prior to ovulation during which the study estimates the odds at 25 so either the seven children were ovulating at the same time and had about four encounters each or they each had closer to 20 encounters over the five or all 28 students were active and about to every scenario presented by this article seems absurdly improbable from the incident itself to the manner of the to a media searching for a scoop this is where we are expected to either get to work debunking the article or to stay so how did our brethren at the start of the post i mentioned that the original article has been linked with confirmation of the original reporting by such mainstream newspapers magazines and websites as the new york post the london daily mail the new york daily news the australian courier mail newser cosmopolitan and perhaps representing the worst offense of the bunch the daily mail added details to the story that were never

2137,following is one of the most unusual media stories of the last on friday esquire magazine posted a blistering piece bashing espn written by the news editor ben it was entitled has a problem with while the column centered on the suspensions of bill simmons and stephen smith the lead produced some exclusive details about coverage plans for monday night namely the network would be having a domestic violence panel featuring 11 different all our bold emphasis has been on monday night a panel on a pregame show for monday night football will among other things address domestic this panel will discuss once again the appropriate penalty for hitting a the panel for that discussion will include the following chris berman cris carter mike ditka adam schefter tom jackson keyshawn johnson jon gruden mike tirico stuart scott steve young and ray up to 11 men all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on zero victims of domestic violence in america are most likely to be women aged when the show has updates from the reports about injuries and the upcoming cut to female sideline reporters lisa salters and on some weeks suzy these people are not allowed at the how collins got that information whether through his own sources or espn itself was never shared with esquire nevertheless the theme kept coming back throughout his piece as a tentpole of the existence of 11 men domestic violence panel and the anger towards it spread slowly throughout the deadspin has a nice recap of how far the story reached as it was noticed on twitter and reblogged across the internet with one feminist organization even putting the network on blast based on the esquire article in a press of course espn is not having an 11 man domestic violence panel the network has explicitly and publicly called the esquire story false as documented but just examining this story from the outset there was plenty to be skeptical about in first of all espn has covered domestic violence and the nfl at length while involving women in the jane mcmanus has been a consistent presence on espn airwaves and espn has a deep bench of female commentators that have talked about the issue on the you can criticize sports networks for not involving women in more prominent ways but espn at least appears to be trying to make an effort mcmanus defended the network on second in light of those tweets no mention of suzy kolber who will be one of the hosts on monday night countdown if any panel discussion happening tonight she be third easy to make fun of espn and the gratuitously absurd amount of nfl analysts the network but who in their right mind would conduct an 11 person panel on a topic like domestic not something that even nancy grace and the cable news networks would be silly enough to if to believe this esquire story chris berman would be moderating an 11 person panel discussion on domestic violence including everyone from the game announcers to not even espn would be that bristol began the the network released their coverage plans for monday night countdown and in a move straight out of the espn pr playbook they also highlighted contributions to their coverage of the nfl domestic violence a rare public statement from john wildhack one of the highest on the espn executive food chain also disputed the esquire contrary to published reports in esquire there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for monday night we will present our normal monday night football show with suzy kolber espn is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence and is committed to continued much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnw platforms including hannah storm jemele hill jane mcmanus kate fagan sarah spain and so how did this haphazard and reckless writing at esquire gradually began to be taken as there never were plans for an 11 men panel to discuss domestic violence on monday night collins merely listed the talent that would be working the show and assumed the topic would come up at some point during the evening in an unbelievable failure in communication through the written collins explained his position in greater detail on his twitter a pretty far cry from what collins actually wrote in his article which made it abundantly clear there would be a special domestic violence panel with enough men to field an entire football to 11 men all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence

2442,leased all million square feet of moffett a sunnyvale office complex under development by jay paul google has cemented a pair of massive real estate deals in sunnyvale and redwood city that boost the silicon valley footprint by million square feet about the size of the empire state building and enough room for more than 10000 even by google standards the latest transactions are in one deal google has agreed to lease all of jay paul moffett place a million square foot office campus currently under construction in a contender for the largest office lease ever signed in silicon valley and perhaps the state of in a separate but no less notable deal mountain google completed the purchase of six buildings from blackstone group and starwood capital totaling about 934000 square feet at redwood pacific shores office first entry into that city and a potential game changer for that commercial real estate is obviously a very strong company and they are in hyper growth said amber schiada director of research for real estate services firm the deals both of which i previously reported were in the works were confirmed by sources close to the google declined to comment for this blackstone return jay longtime broker phil mahoney of newmark cornish carey would only say that moffett place is off the expansion on the peninsula has been the biggest real estate story since the 2008 great recession as the biggest advertising company has bought and leased building after building radiating out from its mountain view its real estate growth dwarfs even that of cisco systems expansion during the terms of the latest deals were not disclosed but sources estimated the redwood city sale at around per square foot or that would make it perhaps single largest real estate acquisition by footprint and dollar amount ever in silicon welcome them to our city and i look forward to working with said redwood city mayor jeffrey gee in an interview this a long time i would go around and say city is one of the best kept secrets in the bay with google and everything going on not a secret aside from sheer size the deals are notable for several first they showcase incredibly ambitious growth plans as the company enters new business sectors such as wearable computing cars and robotics all of which could be huge space users on their google has not even moved into much of the space it has leased or bought over the last several yet the company continues to bank more elbow room for future expansion suggesting it is thinking far down the line in terms of its space google counted 55030 employees globally as of 30 according to its most recent quarterly report up 18 percent or 8600 googlers from a year the transactions also alter the marketplace dynamics in two cities by taking available space off the schiada noted that moffett place was the largest speculatively built project under construction in silicon in redwood pacific shores which is more than 90 percent leased told google will honor all current leases for now but will evaluate moving into spaces as they become available in the years big question is what does this leave for schiada said speaking specifically about the moffett place also increases rates because the supply becomes more still that could actually be a good thing for tenants down the line by pushing developers to build more product she deal essentially eliminates a significant portion of new development which could prompt more developers to move she jim beeger a veteran broker with colliers international said in the short term the sunnyvale deal could also push tenants back into the the transaction could tenants of all sizes to realize they should have more of a sense of urgency in their search for a new he place will be difficult to replicate and those who lingered no longer have this sethena leiker senior analyst for cushman silicon valley office not a lot of spec development she you want to take any new space going to have to take something one result beeger said could be a of growing tenants moving to other areas of santa clara county that have available score for lease at moffett place is a huge win for san jay paul if one not entirely jay paul already leased 949000 square feet to google in sunnyvale at a nearby campus called technology corners making google a natural prospect for the new and while google has not yet started moving into technology corners the company has also been growing elsewhere in sunnyvale this year snapping up the old juniper networks headquarters square and former head office of palm computing square and rumored that a fund cbre global investors buying up land all around moffett park business district is actually acting on behalf of yet landing google guaranteed when jay paul started building moffett place earlier this year on other major tech tenants were also making offers on the property according to the rent google is paying known but jay paul was asking per square foot on a basis or not including utilities taxes and redwood city in redwood city google picks a up a major chunk one of silicon marquee office the project was built by jay paul in the early 2000s and gained notice for its sleek design and swanky amenities including pools a wall day spa and baseball starwood bought the campus in 2006 for about million and immediately sold two buildings to shorenstein the san blackstone came into the picture after acquiring the junior debt on the property a couple of years informatica also acquired two buildings out of the 10 in 2012 for per square acquisition this week is only for the six as i reported earlier this month a new owner could build even more office space at pacific new zoning approved about a year ago could allow total of up to 3 million square google which like many expanding tech companies is focused on reducing its car and shuttle trips as traffic worsens during the current boom may have been attracted to the project partly for its water transit possibilities beyond pacific shores is a half mile from the port of redwood city where a google pilot project earlier this year tested running ferries from san
