168,get ready for the tech press to flip out when apple announces the retail price for the gold apple watch edition model apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers but the apple watch edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of the funny thing in this case is that apple is perfectly right to be charging that much case against the 10000 gold apple watch this was a bit of the now that it has some readership i realize i should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more 200 and 1300 per troy ounce and has been over 1000 per troy ounce for the last five years and that term is regulated by law 905 per troy ounce or 480 per cc anywhere from to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case so the buckle is worth 360 and the watch case 720 to 3800 just as raw gold this is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than 6000 this would equal cc of volume but a watch case so you have to leave room for the movement dial case back etc so just leave 5 mm of thickness all around making a hollow rectangle this equals cc 42 x 36 x 10 32 x 26 x 10 therefore the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost 3200 as of this writing 300 200 worth 1400 pick your thickness and still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold 000 more in 18k gold 000 more in 18k gold 000 extra list for 18k gold 000 list 5800 street 000 list 18200 street 750 extra list for 18k gold 550 list 6800 street 300 list 18400 street but the gist is simple gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel in fact pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under 10000 in any size and from any manufacturer even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny chopard happy sport mini sells for 11000 most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either or less very slim and small or long out of production and with outdated pricing adding a gold bracelet to that bumps the price to 42900 but one simply can not deny the raw material value in a gold watch case and the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities there are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold and plenty of reserves so no company no matter how strong can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials labor distribution and profit in a watch 000 but both represent a traditional offering in the space and both cost more than 20000 with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle and jony ive recently said that the historic cartier tank was one of his inspirations for the apple watch design 000 though not going to happen so likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically as we can see the apple watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions although questionable from an esthetic standpoint this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot second apple watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display sensors and such third the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum not gold to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions in their press releases they do claim it is from and nowhere does it say it is plated or the industry term there are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and apple can not break these any more than tiffany could and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel apple watch to be roughly 1000 it is reasonable to assume that the gold edition model will sell for substantially more than this with many suggesting 4000 or 5000 but remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold even with thin walls and a steel frame hard to see how apple could make a solid gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold but apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as taking that at face value perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch this still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case the apple watch edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes a difference of about 20 in terms of case volume so the smaller model could sell for 20 less still 999 with the 38 mm apple watch edition retailing for 7999 this covers the cost of the gold case the internals manufacturing sales and profit and yet does not leave apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a or plated case i will be shocked if the price is 4999 but i suppose possible with some finagling and if the smaller model and it will not be any less than that 000 product 000 product i predict that availability will be quite limited apple will likely create special spaces in certain apple store locations for the edition i further expect them to open special standalone apple edition boutiques to sell the watch edition accessories and perhaps other future products many people disagree with me and now that gruber fireballed this post i imagine hear from lots of them real soon though he was most visually eloquent suspects it contains much less gold but a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow and it puts the raw gold at about 849 at per gram of 18k gold although this is admittedly much much lower than my estimate it still illustrates my point that the apple watch edition is not going to be cheap and i think way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong something apple is apparently not going to do with the edition that rolex case contained grams of gold alloy but much much smaller than the apple watch and circular to boot a 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference while the 42mm apple watch is 156mm in circumference use the magic of math to scale the rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and at grams but that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel and the apple watch is pretty so we can probably double this safely and come out with 1615 of gold in my mangled square rolex case 500 of gold how much would it sell for certainly not 2000 or 3000 you still have to account for the cost of everything else plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution and profit for apple and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold so back at the 5000 estimate others have made as greg koenig tweeted and forbes reported anyone thinks apple is charging less than 5k for the edition they are smoking important to realize that the price of gold is in the seat when it comes to pricing the apple watch edition and i look forward to updating this piece thanks for reading

200,breitbart texas reports taher he said the tribunal operates under sharia law as a form of dispute said their organization is tribunal not a tribunal is defined by dictionary as court or forum of the four islamic attorneys call themselves not said that participation in the tribunal is voluntary a married couple can not be considered divorced by the islamic community unless it is granted by the he compared their divorce known as as something similar to the catholic practice of annulment in that the church does not recognize civil divorce proceedings as ending a marriage though is a perfectly normal practice within religious groups in america is right that catholics have long gone to catholic authorities to resolve certain questions related to marriage orthodox jews have long gone to jewish religious courts such a court is called a both to resolve marital matters and to resolve commercial disputes some protestants sometimes do the same 1 corinthians is often interpreted as calling for that a catholic who get an annulment might feel obligated not to remarry even if he thinks that he should have gotten the annulment simply because he feels that god wants him to follow the teachings and decisions when that will affect how their coreligionists business partners neighbors and family members perceive them you bet would orthodox jews feel the same you bet and i expect that christians who operate within sufficiently devout and religiously homogeneous communities would have the same reaction for an interesting but rare case of the legal system being asked to intervene to stop such social pressure and refusing to do so see paul watchtower bible tract 9th cir 1987 i think that even in the absence of the free exercise clause that were made in that case but that might be unavailable in many states following employment division smith 1990 a campaign urging people to shun the excommunicated would be protected under the free speech clause see naacp claiborne hardware co 1982 one common argument in favor of religiosity is that community pressure tends to lead people to abide by religious obligations not to steal not to commit adultery and more the flip side is that community pressure tends to lead people to abide by religious obligations that we might not agree with stay with a husband who mistreats you never remarry and so on of course if there is also the threat of violence and not just community pressure then the law can step in to punish the violence and any explicit threats of violence but the possibility of such violence in rare cases allow the legal system to step in to block nonviolent social pressure in other cases under which they agree that the decision would be enforceable in civil court such agreements are common with secular commercial arbitration even when the arbitration is supposed to apply law other than american law english law or french law and they are also permissible for religious arbitration religion or sex i discuss this a bit in this post and the comments to it are also much worth reading but according to the breitbart texas article says that these tribunals do not conduct legally binding arbitrations rather their decisions are followed when they are followed as a result of the acquiescence and community pressure as a result these interesting questions arise here friends neighbors and business partners to have religious decisionmakers decide disputes especially so when the decisions are enforced just by community own religious feelings or by social pressure but that can also be so subject to some limitations when the parties to the dispute agree to binding arbitration which again seem to be in play with the texas islamic tribunal for personal and economic reasons hard for muslims hard for orthodox jews and especially groups such as the satmar hasidim hard for mormons witnesses the amish and members of lots of other groups but a necessary aspect of american social and religious freedom

874,following the deadly shootings at charlie hebdo a french satirical magazine with a history of lampooning religious extremism cartoonists came out in droves to support those who were killed wednesday in the best way they knew how with their own set of tribute cartoons artists from the independent the washington post and more published visual depictions of their reaction to the news of the attack which took the lives of 12 people a death toll that included four prominent cartoonists charlie hebdo editor stephane charbonnier was perhaps the most of those killed wednesday and for those who flocked to facebook instagram and other forms of social media wednesday it appeared that banksy had dedicated his own cartoon to the tragedy but come wednesday night fans of the elusive street artist would be disappointed to learn that no banksy likely did not draw the stunning pencil image believed that the account does not belong to banksy himself not only because official website insists that the artist keeps off social media specifically referencing his lack of a facebook or twitter account this instagram was the only account that was ever linked to banksy but also as business insider notes the cartoon image is far too for an artist with notoriety writes the site he want his work to be displayed in a way that makes it look bad the image itself is striking and a fitting tribute to those who have passed on following the shootings in paris so though possible banksy did not design the cartoon and only leaves you wondering what kind of tribute banksy would publish worth digesting appreciating and using it to remember that violence will never quell freedom of speech

879,matt taibbi is taking a of from pierre first look media according to new york magazine the move comes disagreements with inside organization a source close to first look confirmed however the center of gravity of the organization has shifted as omidyar and his silicon valley braintrust have exerted control over budgets and vacillated over the journalistic mission over the summer omidyar appointed a longtime confidante john temple a former newspaper editor who previously led an civic journalism venture in hawaii to be the president for audience and products putting him in a position above eric bates the former rolling stone editor who was brought on as a first look editorial director who is close to taibbi uh pierre omidyar to a wider mission involving more comedy than reporting around the same time i heard rumors that eric bates was also unhappy at the organization although taibbi would only engage on the condition that his words were for a strange demand coming from an editor at a site about leaking confidential documents i emailed taibbi again today to ask if i can publish his responses in the light of news he replied you may for what little worth is my side of the correspondence from back in july in which i laid out the state of first look as i saw it with a little help from some well placed sources the discussion spirited on both sides all words below are mine just have to try to infer what stated position might have been i ultimately came down on the side of publishing my own responses with words redacted sure some readers with disagree i welcome the discussion an important disclosure taibbi previously worked with mark ames on russian newspaper the exile it has been widely reported that the two are no longer on speaking terms i discuss this post with mark before publishing here are the jul 29 2014 redacted taibbi quote denying my story right but not the part that seems to have changed changed is that description of the site yesterday made zero mention of wall street gone from finance first to politics first more broadly and happy to stay off the record clearly something weird going on over there why does a 250m journalism project have to shift focus before launched it suggests po has no clue how to handle talent and so is retreating back to technology with questions of his own here my reply jul 29 2014 i think omidyar took you aside and ordered you not to cover his friends i think either you made the decision yourself for reasons of an easier life or his blog post was the first you heard about the change and he just publicly fucked you over knowing what i do about his management style leaning towards the latter but i emailed you because i actually want to understand going on jul 29 2014 redacted if i waited for pierre and his staffers to respond to questions never publish a thing about first look given po 48hrs to respond before and still got nothing sure always held stories indefinitely until you receive a response as for your bizarre chain of straw man arguments i say hired you to shut you up so no i believe something you just made up as you say that would be real redacted analysis what i i think pierre has any idea why he hired you and i think entirely sure either perhaps he was looking for names that looked good on a press release and you fit the bill i think tired and i think you knew the rolling stone gig going to last for ever i think po offered you complete editorial freedom and promised you a blank check to build your own team for that reason i think announcement yesterday should be terrifying to you and to anyone else who works at flm lost his nerve for a combination of reasons and is retreating to something he understands technology and platforms spoken to people who have known omidyar for decades and people who have worked with him on previous publications if you seriously think going to have your back when you go after his pals more naive well than you are tired of this conversation now i honestly tell if being a team player or if you believe any of this crap sure continue to cover flm and continue to ask for comment when i do entirely up to you if you respond before publication or wait until afterwards and then bitch on twitter either way continue to read your wall st stuff you publish it just as i read and enjoyed your most recent book on a long flight a few weeks back best of luck paul jul 30 2014 tired of it because you refuse to actually engage in conversation laid out my position clearly and honestly and asked follow up questions you actually address any of my points you just keep lobbing back straw men and not engaging with what saying at the very least turned into a corporate flack for first look continuing to hammer away at a caricatured version of what i said while refusing to answer questions and demanding that the whole thing stay off the record so that readers continue to be left in the dark the last person who tried that line of attack over a pando story was lanny davis redacted told you what i believe but humor you and your enjoyment at playing pr flack by saying it again this time line by redacted taibbi quote i think unlikely pierre you to stop writing about wall street say the odds are almost zero not that fucking stupid what i said of course i think he took you aside and ordered you not to cover his friends i think either you made the decision yourself for reasons of an easier life or his blog post was the first you heard about the change and he just publicly fucked you my question which you seem keen to answer did you know pierre was going to leave finance out of his post about what your editorial mission would be if not that worry you if so what is the reasoning behind not mentioning the thing that you are best known for but which is likely to make your sole funder and boss the most uncomfortable a question what are we to make of the fact that first look journalists greenwald in particular insist that pierre has no control over editorial indeed insisted similar in this conversation and yet the one laying out the editorial plan why that be the job of the actual editors instead we have your 250m funder issuing a statement that marginalizes the one aspect of your work that might sting him while reassuring the world that worry he intends to permit you and greenwald to continue doing your jobs but that he has decided to axe plans for all the other editorial sites he previously in a video starring him said he would fund what does the phrase actually mean at first look redacted taibbi quote i think what he told you when you were first hired yes people are told lots of things on first dates redacted taibbi quote never said otherwise a total red herring redacted taibbi quote redacted i mention anything in my story about pierre ordering you to stop writing because as made clear i believe that would make any sense i mention what i suspect you might have been told when you were hired because again i know what i know and what i wrote is that the public statements about your mission have changed i mention it being a satirical publication because that changed redacted taibbi quote a press release about what your job and focus will be written by the man who writes your pay checks and who is backing down on almost all of the editorial strategy that was in place when you were hired a press release that was at odds with all previous statements about what your focus will be specifically leaving out the one thing that would seem to have the potential to make omidyar most concerned yes i believe that means you will be focussing far less on that aspect of things and yes i believe that either a choice consciously made or a choice pierre is attempting to make for you through passive aggressive public messaging your choice of denial is interesting redacted the same line greenwald used when he was challenged on whether he would write about business interests clear enough to sound like a denial but general enough to allow you to focus most of your energies away from wall street do you at least concede that previously the chief focus of your site was to be on finance and now on politics and if the of the site still on uncovering financial corruption yes or no if yes why did your boss mischaracterize the site so badly in his blog post and if no why not redacted taibbi quote pierre has been interfering with first editorial plans from the start every single editorial plan first look has exists only at pleasure he is your sole funder and he is the one making public statements about how he intends to allocate those resources how is it possible you understand wall street so well but understand that redacted taibbi quote yes that is apparent from statement redacted taibbi quote i had plenty of information and printed what i knew after giving you the opportunity to respond before publication have plenty more information to set the record straight if answer any of the questions above or better still stop hiding behind for why if being so unfairly maligned you let any of the above be shared with readers the whole basis of first look to make all the information public and let readers decide why that apply to conversations about first look and its billionaire owner which leads me to my last question have you or any first look staffer to the best of your knowledge signed an nda or non disparagement contract either as a standalone or as part of your employment contract s right this is an enjoyable conversation now shift it up a gear and get to some real answers paul taibbi stopped responding when i asked him he had signed any kind of contract restricting his freedom to talk openly about first look i asked if he had anything to add to his previous comments he replied that your story was wrong then and still

joined the islamic state probably in the commission of hammond said of these people may seek at some point to return to the and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic and the speech of

from the prisoner family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers the government for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent he says he asks his parents not to accept meager compensation from the same people who effectively hit the last nail in my coffin with the recent aerial campaign in who is a member of the air to about what you are he says wish i could have

1120,pentagon investigating claims but admits one load missing and it would be embarrassing if it ended up in terror hands some rusty some new a canister is broken out to reveal a hand grenade it would be an embarrassment for the us given the advanced precision technology available to its air force mainly from the dysfunctional iraqi army isis is reported to have stolen seven american m1 abrams tanks from three iraqi army bases in anbar province last week rear admiral john kirby told reporters that analysts at centcom headquarters in tampa florida were examining the video still taking a look at it and assessing the validity of he said i honestly know if that was one of the one supplied by kurdish authorities in the region of northern iraq to their compatriots in kobani which sits close to the border isis fighters have encircled much of the town he said though that we are very confident that the vast majority of the bundles did end up in the right hands in fact only aware of one bundle that did the boxes appeared to contain parts for grenades some of the equipment appears to be east european in origin which might seem odd given the weapons were dropped by americans but the munitions were supplied by the kurdish authorities who had been stocking up with kurdish forces in control of most of the city the coalition has mounted more than 130 air strikes round the town in an effort to stop isis taking complete control cloud cover last week prevented them hitting much of the rest of iraq particularly around the contested mosul dam if the dam was to fall to i it would provide huge leverage for the group a strategic loss with potentially catastrophic consequences in particular armoured vehicles

1122,forget targeted us airstrikes isis faces a new existential threat citing an unnamed source in a mosul hospital iraq official newspaper al sabaah said ebola arrived in mosul from terrorists who came from several countries and africa mashable further confirms three outlets reported that ebola showed up at a hospital in mosul for now it unclear if any disease experts or doctors in mosul are even able to test for the ebola virus but it would mark the first time the virus had been detected in an area controlled by isis a group that does embrace science and modern medicine but the organization has reached out to offer assistance christy feig who director of communications told mashable a task that could be a challenge given the restrictions that would come with operating in territory who was convinced the cases are ebola told the kurdish media outlet xendan that the militants symptoms were similar to those of the ebola virus iraq official newspaper al sabaah said the disease arrived in mosul from terrorists who came from several countries and africa at this point seems highly unlikely it would mark the first time the virus had been detected in an area controlled by isis a group that does embrace science and modern medicine militants affiliated with isis have executed more than a dozen doctors in mosul according to benjamin decker an intelligence analyst with the levantine group a middle geopolitical risk and research consultancy as the international business times reports officials are denying the reports which broke out in march in west africa he said the reports that ebola has infected anyone in mosul are incorrect and unfounded perhaps most concerning the militants could use it as a biological terror technique forbes reported in october members could contract the virus on purpose and then go to foreign countries to infect others national security professor al shimkus told forbes the context of terrorist activity it take much sophistication to go to that next step to use a human being as a
1123,the very first nonsense i had to debunk in 2014 was a claim that on 4 of that year a planetary alignment would cause gravity to decrease allowing you to float momentarily or fall more slowly if you jumped in the air at the right moment g this exact same hoax has resurfaced this week in a couple of places so decided to update the debunking to include some new links and repost it hopefully to stem the tide of silliness at end it seems fitting that hopefully this is also the last debunking make in but who knows still a week left now heard it that the caused earthquakes and that a magnetic pole flip of the earth will cause superstorms and another saying the earth is already physically starting to flip over we now have the claim that early next 4 2015 at pst to be to the combined gravity of jupiter and pluto you will be able to jump in the air and float for just a couple of seconds or at least fall more slowly depending on different this exact same hoax was pulled last year in 2014 by a site called news hound now offline apparently and a lot of people fell for it here we are again a year later back at the same spot this time the joke is being made by a site called daily buzz live which even bother to change much of the wording of the original hoax they even have a picture of a nasa tweet about the event and it was presumably made up wholesale for the article on daily buzz live whoever did it was clever adding the number of retweets and favorites but as fake as a 20 iphone you can buy on the street in new york city the physics of g is wrong the claim about pluto and jupiter is wrong this part is the real based on a joke made by an astronomer nearly 40 years ago spreading around facebook and twitter so much once again that i got a lot of people asking or telling me about it why debunking this thing again the claim on the morning of january 4th 2014 an extraordinary astronomical event will occur at exactly am the planet pluto will pass directly behind jupiter in relation to the earth this rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull temporarily counteracting the own gravity and making people weigh less moore calls this the gravitational effect except this is all baloney to be polite ok so why is this wrong sitting in a tree the gravitational forces of the other planets in the solar system have essentially zero effect on you personally fine give some brief details the planets are big objects with lots of gravity but that only affects you if close to them space however is why we call it planets are far away this weakens their gravity on you hugely reducing it to less than the impact of the flutter of a wing then here you go even if you add all of the planets together they pull on you with a force less than 2 percent of that of the moon the daily buzz live article mentions tides too but even worse the combined tidal force from the planets is far less like percent of the simply put the planets are just too far away to have any real effect on you by the way the moon orbits the earth on an ellipse so its own gravity fluctuates far more than the combined strength of the planets every two weeks the gravity from pluto is weakest of them all pluto is a teeny tiny ice ball far smaller than even our moon and at its closest 4 billion kilometers billion miles from earth a long way a car on the road half a kilometer away has more gravitational pull on you than pluto does doing the math i find that the earth pulls on you about 200 trillion times harder than pluto does that about the same ratio as the number of cells in your body to a single cell so this claim that you can float is like saying you can shed a single cell and fly away by flapping your arms i checked on that day they are on nearly opposite sides of the sky really far apart about you have picked a much worse date to claim pluto was behind jupiter shame on you an enormously popular radio and television science program predated carl sagan and is still considered an icon of science in england as points out it was an april fools day joke moore made this claim in 1976 on his radio program to my complete unsurprise apparently some folks called in to say they did feel the effect this is called where you tell people in advance that feel something due to some cause and they will even if the cause never happened used by ghost hunters and ghost tour guides quite a bit to spook people before they actually enter a guaranteeing feel chills as they walk from room to room seen this myself first hand people can convince themselves of amazing things that never actually happened but i share it smart people fall for silly things all the time and intelligence really the prime factor here schools teach people how to analyze a claim how to tell if something makes sense on the surface of it or how to go about looking into the claim i knew right away to do the math and to see if pluto and jupiter really were aligned as the article says but all too often people think carefully or at all about these claims and simply spread them through social media all it takes is literally the click of a button pseudoscience thrives via this virulence whereas truth must take a harder path why i bother debunking stuff like this sure this is a silly claim and probably harmless in practice but not all of them are i already mentioned the from 2012 and i can tick off a dozen other doomsday or scary claims that spread due to a lack of skepticism and of course there are real issues like global warming denial and more which live and breathe and spread due to a lack of skepticism in the public i said particular bit of fluff will dry up and float away in a day or two but those others are here to stay for a long i was wrong and i known that something like this would resurface again in a year like the as big as the nonsense that comes back year after year my hope is that every time we take a moment to inject a bit of polite skepticism into everyday lives it makes the world a slightly better place to be we can change to

1344,according to a new report from 9to5mac a new macbook air is coming the new computer is alleged to have screen but remain about the size of the model via reduced bezels on all sides possibly even cooler than that is the computer is said to be an actual thing not like the ipad pro we keep hearing about sources inside apple claim to have been with the new device which is also lighter than existing macbook airs there are several other interesting nuances here the macbook is sporting a single usb port which sounds silly but like external monitors the new usb standard is also capable of charging so magsafes might be dead sd card slot thunderbolt and you be able to natively charge and use an external monitor the natural assumption here is that apple will release some sort of hub alongside the new macbook air for those occasions when multitasking is necessary but the keyboard has reportedly been minimized to accommodate the slimmer profile that means smaller keys closer together even though the keyboard is said to go but a touch taller to accommodate the larger screen speaker grilles toward the top of the keyboard double as vents for the cpu too here retina sadly nothing in the report suggest get a retina macbook air with the refresh fans of the dense apple screens find favor there but all still marvel at the thin profile should this actually come to pass as reported

1347,the apple watch might be water resistant according to comments reported by french site igen via appleinsider either that or it a misunderstanding and we do really know which apple ceo tim cook reportedly told employees at an apple store in berlin that he wears his apple watch everywhere even in the shower it could indicate that apple will market the device as one or the other and there could be some translation issues it might even have been a joke we have no context with which to judge this story so do invest too much in this rumor just yet i personally doubt the device is water resistant or proof even if the device is sealed water and touch screens do typically work well together at all that would make it a coup for if anyone could do it it is i not expecting a water resistant or proof apple watch based on this anecdote cook also reportedly says he charges his apple watch every night this is in keeping with the very rough comments from apple at the device unveiling in september at that time we were told apple had designed the watch to be charged at night though the company was unspecific about how long it would actually run i can believe that has changed but we still do have context for the comments

1362,our retina macbook air rumour article brings together everything we know or can plausibly predict about apple next macbook air laptop a laptop that we pretty sure will come with a retina display we also interested in rumours that apple will be launching its next macbook air in a new size one based on a 12in screen so you know exactly when the new retina macbook air will launch the retina macbook air specs features and design its uk pricing and availability and all the rest of the clues and hints circulating on the web that could help us work out what to expect and when to expect it finally we will show you any retina macbook air images that surface online together with concept and mockup illustrations produced by clever artists with an eye for prediction clues and rumours about the next macbook air so bookmark this page and check back here regularly for the latest information about the new macbook air with retina display based the site says on information from sources who have used prototypes more info in the macbook air redesign section find out what in store for next year apple rumours and predictions for 2015 but here goes it been suggested by a number of websites that apple will launch its next range of macbooks during the christmas holidays this seems to be a case of a reasonable article by boy genius report written back in august being rehashed and misinterpreted this month bgr wrote that the next macbook air would be ready in time for the christmas holidays not launched during them releasing during the holidays would be a truly bizarre move denying the products access to the lucrative shopping period that nuance seems to have been lost in translation and beyond this the article was as we said written in august at which point a launch still seemed possible now we pretty much certain that the retina macbook air will have to wait until 2015 7 jan 2015 sure enough no macbook air appeared over christmas the very idea the latest rumour suggests instead that a radically 12in macbook air will launch in perhaps making an appearance at wwdc see more details and images in the design section below but this was mainly to reduce prices the processor bump was very slight read our reviews of the current macbook air range here 11in 2014 macbook air review and macbook air 2014 13in review and a retina display giving customers the option of a slighly bigger screen or it may replace the model where customers could instead opt for the comparitively priced macbook pro with retina display quanta computer was set to begin production of the new macbook air in july this may have started if the new intel chips arrived in time and some of these models will be available in october according to intel acer asus dell hp lenovo and toshiba are all using the core m reports suggest that the new retina macbook air will be available in time for christmas the site claimed that its sources in the taiwanese supply chain said that the production of components for the new macbook had begun and that it may launch before the end of this year or next year there are also reports that suggest the new retina macbook air could be delayed until next year it may not be using these core m chips relying instead on a different series of intel core i5 broadwell processors more on that below claiming that the date has already been pushed back on multiple occasions new colours thinner design 9to5mac posted a series of images that it says show the next macbook air radical new design although many of the most major changes to the keyboard layout for instance are obviously in the former category the new design is for a laptop with a new screen size 12 inches yet the slimming process in these designs is so extreme that the new 12in macbook air actually has a smaller body than the existing 11in macbook air the screen is a little bigger but everything around the screen has been shrunk at any rate is how the new 12in macbook air left will compare to the current 11in macbook air right smaller and reversible usb and a headphone socket along with a couple of microphone holes on the left if this is right the macbook will have to be powered via the usb port and sure enough usb will be perfectly adequate for that purpose it just means that you wo be able to use a usb hard drive wired mouse or wireless mouse dongle or other usb accessory while the macbook is plugged in and it possible likely we would say that the eventual layout will be less extreme we think the magsafe power connection is likely to survive the keyboard is also designed differently the power button now sits next to the esc key at the corner of the keyboard and the keys have in general been shrunk down and squeezed together the trackpad on the other hand has been expanded and now comes closer to the keys 9to5mac images are the first apparent leak about the next macbook air design a blogger who appears to have a source with plausible information about the new macbook air seems to have become the the blogger for all macbook air rumours there have certainly been other young bloggers who have gained insight into unannounced apple products but as yet we ca be sure the claims are legitimate silver and space grey finishes more on that below now he claims his source has told him that the new design is so thin apple has had to switch to a new reversible usb type c connector which is significantly smaller than usb 3 it although marsh source was clear on whether this had been finalised yet as well as the usual aluminium claiming that they are aware that apple has at least considered launching the 12in notebook with several different edition colour options and it would be the first time apple has introduced a range of colour choices on their mac laptops but there have been claims that quanta computer will be building a rumoured ipad later this year and it could be the ipad pro that is being referred to here sources claim apple wishes to introduce a smaller macbook air to make clearer the distinction between the macbook air and the ipad air with its screen with the model being phased out in favour of the macbook pro with retina display a chip that does need fans by using this processor it is claimed that apple could make the laptop 9mm thin the macbook air is currently thick so it could be almost 1cm thinner at its thickest point according to reports but that may not be necessary the new intel processors are said to be efficient enough to make the removal of the fan feasible indeed there are already laptops on the market that do not feature a fan though the new broadwell processor should enable a fanless design for the smaller up to laptop or mobile device notes motley fool based on what intel said at its developer forum in 2013 and it could also offer higher battery capacity because the remaining space could be used to house a bigger battery leading to hardware failure which is smaller than usb 3 it usb type c is able to support 10gbps data transfers which is twice as fast as usb 3 but still slower than thunderbolt 2 although the same as the older thunderbolt 1 which is apparently enough to power 4k displays as apple thunderbolt cable does currently the only problem is that usb type c is the new macbook air will be thinner and lighter a feat it will achieve by removing the fan and the clicking mechanism in the trackpad according to this report from ben latest news and it certainly possible the macbook air is currently let down by its display which has a lower resolution than the competition 732x1536 pixels the same 264ppi that the ipad air offers stating it turns out that an retina macbook air with a 2732 x 1536 resolution happens to have the exact same pixel density as the 2048 x 1536 retina ipads ppi it would make sense for apple to take advantage of the same display technology it has been utilizing for the ipads by cutting their panels to this larger size 304 x 1440 for a rumoured 12in display discussed below that 226 pixels per inch compared to 227 pixels per inch for the 13in macbook pro which offers resolution this adds up to a aspect ratio like that found on the 13in macbook air and macbook pro models rather than the aspect ratio currently offered by the 11in macbook air rumours suggested that apple was planning to launch a revamped macbook air with a retina display in the of a separate report in march 2013 also claimed that apple would introduce a retina display to the macbook air in since this did happen in 2013 it is perhaps likely for 2014 and also introduced a retina ipad mini in october 2013 and what a retina hd display offering improved power efficiency the reason for the supposition is that apple was recruiting for a engineers with experience in led backlighting and lcd displays in february according to cultofmac in an lcd display the bunches of pixels with wires running behind to connect them the backlight has to shine though this mesh of wires to light up the pixels in an igzo display more light is able to shine though this mesh of wires so the power requirements are lower and battery life can be preserved as a result we could see even longer battery life than the 12 hours currently on offer from the 13in macbook air evercore partners analyst patrick wang predicted that a 12in hybrid would launch in the autumn of it is possible that the rumoured retina display macbook air could be this mac because this chip does need fans the new macbook air could be less than a centimeter thick at its thickest point since it uses the 14nm processor the processor itself it is tiny according to intel intel says it will offer seven times the graphics power of machines and double the graphical and three times the web performance of the current range of tablets intel has not confirmed that apple will use the new processor in the press release regarding the new chip intel mentions acer asus dell hp lenovo and toshiba as potentially using the core some of these models will be available in october according to intel large tablets and devices and intel is positioning the chips as being for use in laptops of tablets above 10in and dual devices apple would traditionally use the core i5 chips in its macbook so it is possible that these processors will never appear in a macbook air which may instead use the new u broadwell processor which may not ship until 2015 which did exactly set the world alight benchmark speed tests and overall reviews rated the device quite poorly it therefore been suggested that apple may give the core m a miss and go instead for an i5 or i7 chip some analysts have argued that lenovo implementation of the core m rather than the innate qualities of the core m itself was to blame for the performance and that apple engineers would be able to coax solid performance from a core macbook air we shall see it should make the retina display macbook air possible broadwell is said to consume 30 percent less power than its predecessor haswell and that should be good news for battery life on the portable macs especially those with power hungry screens 4g wwan and wigig networks like those found in the ipad and iphone perhaps an ipad pro rumours that apple will move from intel to arm chips seem unlikely based on this explaination from cult of mac which is less than in this compares to the macbook pro retina starting price of however the fact that the the range iphone 6 plus costs more than the entry level macbook air makes us think that the macbook air price is more likely to increase as that model is similar in price to the macbook pro with retina but not equal in specs this would leave the cheaper macbook air models with potentially an price of the macbook pro with retina display started at this was reduced to a few months later when the range received a processor upgrade now with the april 2014 update to the macbook air the price of the model is a much more compelling which makes the difference between the macbook pro with retina display and the macbook air rather than kgi securities analyst kuo suggested that the price of this new macbook air model could be lower than the current line up of mac laptops the main change for the new macbook air models was the price each model is now under with prices starting at less than the previous models this helps keep the macbook air an attractive option for customers as the previous price was not much different to the price of the new macbook pro with retina display there were suggestions that the new macbook air with retina display could launch at wwdc but this was obviously not the case read more here 2013 the key reason may be the availability of intel processors rather than the production of the new design in a conference call about intel results on 15 july intel chief executive brian krzanich confirmed hardware partners will have broadwell systems on store shelves in the run up to christmas he said we said we would have products on shelves for the holiday season and we continue to work with our partners and on schedule to have product on shelf in the holiday some of these new chips are now shipping however anyone awaiting the new retina macbook pro macbook air imac and mac mini should note that there are various broadwell chips being developed by intel and the chips that intel confirmed are shipping now are the m variety destined for fanless the new macbook air may use the u broadwell processor which may not ship until 2015 but this might not arrive until 2015 or the rumours could relate to the 12in macbook however tim cook last year ruled out any kind of convergence suggesting that a toaster refrigerator would work will it discontinue the existing models it possible that if apple launches a 12in retina macbook air model it will discontinue both or either of the existing models equally apple could maintain one of the existing models as an model it seems more likely that it would keep the 11in model on at an even lower price rather than keep on the bigger 13in model despite costing less if apple wants a low end option it would appear unlekely that the retina macbook air would be it so this is a bit of an rumour but it really is possible that apple will one day release a new macbook air with a solar powered display apple was granted a patent that described a method for harnessing sunlight to illuminate a macbook display this patent is actually the seventh patent apple has gained in the past two years there are no new macbook air leaked images to share with you but we will update this story as soon as one surfaces on the web however or the space grey iphone 5s there are calls for a black version of the macbook air tuaw has provided some renders of how such a macbook air could look reviews and features here

it is a hoax a man living on the streets of california being taken to a sushi restaurant before staying in a hotel room complete with a hot tub on christmas eve that have gained more than 26million views are part of a campaign to raise more than 120000 via an indiegogo page for thomas to get his life back on track viewers have questioned its authenticity citing a number of apparent flaws in the footage as well as the hefty profit paler lin has reportedly made from its success up to a huge 52000 homeless thomas who became an internet hit after spending a 100 donation on food for his friends is given a new suit and a makeover he is also seen spreading out on the white sheets of the bed in his luxury hotel room paler lin asks thomas what he would do with 100000 he says i come into some money i am going to go to three shelters that helped me out and i am going to buy a bunch of bus tickets for people suggesting it is a so he can gain traffic and profit with the handle clemtheranter said large number of youtube prank videos are staged he said was involved in a bloody eyeball scare prank by josh paler lin my part of the video was staged me getting scared by josh thomas was treated to a buffet meal at the end of the day by paler lin deeming it a creation that was focused on making money california only for him to walk into a liquor mart left and buy food for his struggling friends right viewers have questioned the video authenticity citing a number of in the footage above lin is pictured in a facebook photo he is for producing videos for youtube 000 above in red according to which tracks youtube channel statistics but it never happened money via advertisements on the social networking site said one youtube user referring to the site personalities such as paler lin youtube personality lin wrote think thomas had a good meal in november 2013 paler lin gave another homeless man 100 and told an actor playing a beggar to approach him to ask for money for food again the real beggar handed over some cash with the handle rants claimed the start of paler lin recent homeless video which sees the director hand thomas 100 before secretly following him with a camera immediately suggests it may be a hoax not a cheaper grocery store why did he set out to a homeless person spending 100 on booze he said paler lin could not possibly have guaranteed the man was going to pick up his things and spend the money immediately instead of remaining by the roadside he said thomas was filmed emerging with bags filled with food before going straight to a park where he handed out the goods to a number of homeless people the user questioned the beggar choice of a liquor mart a walk away for his food shop instead of a nearer cheaper supermarket saying seems like an odd coincidence with the handle cornelius said the video would shortly be as fake with the handle clemtheranter said lin is a prankster whom previously worked on a video with him that was up to gain traffic he said was involved in a bloody eyeball scare prank by josh paler lin above footage of the apparently eyeball prank of all places go to a liquor store to buy chips and pie or whatever when you think that there are tons of other places to go to that are convenient probably cheaper oh look at that it a happy twist ending and that would make people share it paler lin argued that thomas chose the liqour store because it was closest to his begging spot saying people see you getting all this traffic they want to bring you down he did not explain why thomas chose to drag several bags of food 34 minutes to the park instead of shopping at least two stores that were closer to the park thomas apparently begrudgingly accepts the 100 cash from him where he purchases food for his beggar friends not alcohol maybe he would buy alcohol maybe he he said of the video wanted to see what a homeless person would spend it on no one has ever done that before the youtube user claimed the number of hits received by paler lin previous youtube videos between 600000 to 800000 according to a site that tracks youtube channel statistics could have prompted him to construct what he knew would be a viral hit paler lin who earns money based on how many users view his videos most of which are not only scooped 52000 from the film but also gained 13000 new subscribers probably added the user meaning he would be able to edit out bad acting paler lin said on youtube expecting to get this kind of footage to be honest i thought this video would be more an exposing homeless people video at first but i actually met an incredible human being and a friend we were following him for a couple miles for almost an hour or so thomas told paler lin he had quit his job to look after his parents but after both of them died he could afford to pay for their condo and found himself on the street lin pictured left gave another homeless man right 100 and told an actor playing a beggar to approach him to ask for money for food the video gained far fewer views than thomas the beggar handed over some cash left prompting the actor to hug him right paler lin said he later took the man the man out for dinner and put him up in a hotel for the night he also gave him an extra 100 cash the more i sense how genuine he i gave him my number and told him to call me when he needs help never judge a book by its cover one love he said paler lin has posted a number of photos of thomas to instagram including the beggar dressed in a suit and eating a couple of christmas meals

hoax in particular has insisted that there was no way that thomas did not know he was being filmed as in the original video he arrived at the liquor store in the same car as paler lin homeless thomas who became an internet hit after spending a 100 donation on food for his friends is given a new suit and a makeover 26 told vocativ that he was outside the liquor store on the day in question and he saw paler lin who is recognized from his previous videos in the driver seat he claims was thomas it is clear that from what i saw every part of that scene was staged thomas has now spoken to fox la insisting that to him it was a surprise and he had never met josh before he was handed the 100 most definitely it all a surprise to me i thought this was just a project video i had no idea this was going where it went maybe five as a big tip but a hundred wow that a week worth crazy thomas proved to be an exception instead he spent the money on food to share with his friends prompting paler lin to return and surprise thomas with a christmas meal makeover and a night in a hotel deeming it a creation that was focused on making money that have gained more than 26million views are part of a campaign to raise more than 120000 via an indiegogo page for thomas to get his life back on track as well as the hefty profit paler lin has reportedly made from its success up to a huge 52000 suggesting it is a so he can gain traffic and profit with the handle clemtheranter said large number of youtube prank videos are staged he said was involved in a bloody eyeball scare prank by josh paler lin my part of the video was staged me getting scared by josh california only for him to walk into a liquor mart left and buy food for his struggling friends right but it never happened money

ask for money for food again the real beggar handed over some cash with the handle rants claimed the start of paler lin recent homeless video which sees the director hand thomas 100 before secretly following him with a camera immediately suggests it may be a hoax he said paler lin could not possibly have guaranteed the man was going to pick up his things and spend the money immediately instead of remaining by the roadside he said thomas was filmed emerging with bags filled with food before going straight to a park where he handed out the goods to a number of homeless people thomas was treated to a buffet meal at the end of the day by paler lin the user questioned the beggar choice of a liquor mart a walk away for his food shop instead of a nearer cheaper supermarket saying seems like an odd coincidence of all places go to a liquor store to buy chips and pie or whatever when you think that there are tons of other places to go to that are convenient probably cheaper paler lin argued that thomas chose the liqour store because it was closest to his begging spot saying people see you getting all this traffic they want to bring you down he did not explain why thomas chose to drag several bags of food 34 minutes to the park instead of shopping at least two stores that were closer to the park maybe he would buy alcohol maybe he would he said of the video wanted to see what a homeless person would spend it on no one has ever done that before the youtube user claimed the number of hits received by paler lin previous youtube videos between 600000 to 800000 according to a site that tracks youtube channel statistics could have prompted him to construct what he knew would be a viral hit paler lin who earns money based on how many users view his videos most of which are not only scooped 52000 from the film but also gained 13000 new subscribers paler lin said on youtube was expecting to get this kind of footage to be honest i thought this video would be more an exposing homeless people video at first thomas told paler lin he had quit his job to look after his parents but after both of them died he could afford to pay for their condo and found himself on the street the more i sense how genuine he i gave him my number and told him to call me when he needs help never judge a book by its cover one love paler lin said lin pictured left gave another homeless man right 100 and told an actor playing a beggar to approach him to ask for money for food the video gained far fewer views than thomas

1594,update the story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts news has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near managua nicaragua late saturday night just 13 hours or so before the close flyby of asteroid 2014 rc leading some to suggest that the two events are related however according to experts who have been examining the evidence including those at nasa the two events are completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space an explosion occurred around saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over 12 metres 39 feet wide and about metres 5 feet deep in a wooded area just to the west of the city international airport and just south of the highway from shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the explosion officials with nicaragua institute of territorial studies inet which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the agency seismic instruments wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence afp you can see two waves first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just do add up flying underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there is roughly a difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these events it not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there are over 11000 known asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we have detected and likely wo because they too small while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are alone some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them some are best described as piles which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a shape by their mutual gravity others can be travelling along in with some members preceding or lagging behind the leader possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground just because two events an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact happen close to one another does mean that they are related we saw this back in 2013 when we were watching asteroid 2012 da14 sweep by earth and suddenly a wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk russia the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence that appears to be the case for this event although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast typically around 17 kilometres per second or over 60000 that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass overhead it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky especially when it happened near a city of over 2 million people strauch said it was very strange that no one reported a streak of light we have to ask if anyone has a photo or something some 20 to 30 kilometres above the ground making them visible far and wide across the countryside professional meteorite hunter and host of science channel meteorite men tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic booms during the object dark flight and then the impact he also said that to produce a crater like the one seen it would have to be an iron meteorite as they are the densest and have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on earth donald yeomans the author of objects finding them before they find us said there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact what was this if it was a meteorite one very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion as there are still thousandsin cas buried throughout the country remnants of the war fought there in the 1980s it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day as tons of material is swept up by earth as the planet orbits the sun many of these are missed because they occur during the day or over regions of the planet that are heavily populated some countries have camera networks to capture these events with data being reported on sites like and the university of western ontario canada as an example there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in managua but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the atlantic ocean over eastern spain as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video note what appears to be a second object that may be a piece breaking off the primary one

1692,they verified that the recording is what it claims to be but with competition for this story among the media so ferocious go figure that choose to put it on the air and worry about authenticity later as of last night the fbi was investigating between the ip and the fact that the video file is presumably timestamped i assume be able to verify or debunk it quickly it could be a prank the man who recorded it seems to be er a video chat while it happened but what caught saying is tame if you were going to prank cnn by getting them to air something sexually explicit in the name of reporting news be more explicit than this no it tells us how many shots were fired the attorney tells don lemon she hears 11 shots i hear a forensic examiner who listened to the tape told cnn he heard least six shots followed by a pause followed by four more the autopsy report from the forensic pathologist claims brown was hit at least six times all from the front that means that he was hit at least twice in the first flurry of six shots heard here and furthermore that he was facing wilson at some point during that flurry bizarre to me that brown would have turned back to face a man who was still in the process of firing at him at fairly close range but i know what other conclusion can be drawn based on what we know the fact that brown had apparently been wounded before the fateful pause during which he either rushed wilson or tried to surrender is also important the prosecution will argue that wilson having already drawn blood should have realized that a weakened brown was no longer as much of a physical threat wilson will argue that he felt threatened precisely because brown allegedly kept coming after he was wounded a man strong enough to take two shots and angry enough about it to advance on a cop with a gun was lethally dangerous say dorian johnson described what happened to them in line with the side door they could see the face they heard him say something to the effect of you say at the same time johnson says the officer attempted to thrust his door open but the door slammed into brown and bounced closed johnson says the officer with his left hand grabbed brown by the johnson says he fixed his gaze on the officer to see if he was pulling a stun gun or a real gun when he saw the muzzle of the gun he said had it pointed at him and said one more johnson noted whose two passengers were screaming crouching down a bit he watched brown run past bro he said brown yelled then brown yelled it a second time those would be the last words friend would ever say to him the officer took his second shot striking brown in the back at that point johnson says brown stopped turned with his hands up and said have a gun stop shooting then the first shot to hit brown was fired while wilson was still sitting in the squad car struggling with him which at least would explain how brown was hit from the front during the first flurry brown then managed to run three car lengths before wilson presumably still inside the car fired his second shot hitting brown in the back we know from the autopsy report that the last detail is false after listening to this audio the timeline on the first part seems false too virtually no delay between the first and second shots fired certainly not long enough for words to be exchanged between brown and johnson unless the audio here picks up after the first shot was fired unless it begins with actually the second shot fired at brown i know how to square account with this darren wilson and the teenager michael brown officer wilson was inside his patrol car at the time while brown who was unarmed was leaning in through an open window brown ran away the officer got out of his car and began firing toward brown and then brown stopped turned around and faced the officer since there must have been a delay of a second or two between the first shot that went off inside the car wilson getting out of the car taking aim at brown and then firing again that delay on the audio the first six shots are basically continuous saying have a gun stop shooting alleged friend josie told dana loesch that brown taunted wilson and then rushed him does the length of the pause here rule either of those out

1722,stories are coming out of managua nicaragua that a large bang was heard by residents there saturday evening and it registered on seismic detectors as well a crater was found in the woods measuring something like 12 meters 40 feet across claims are being made that this was a meteorite impact a space rock a meter or so across slamming into the ground at high speed public speaker science evangelizer and author of death from the skies but my biggest doubts come in two parts expect a fireball around midnight been seen by a lot of people i heard any confirmed reports of witnesses also i seen any video from it either the situation in chelyabinsk in 2013 was different of course but video of that event showed up with an hour or two expect that after two days have some visual evidence from managua by now but not a bright meteor that came in over spain be fooled by hoaxes there are always lots of them when something like this happens the picture at the top of this post appears in a lot of hoaxes it was from a fireball over the netherlands in 2009 there should be debris in the crater at the very least on a microscopic scale i heard of any analysis of the soil there to look for fragments either too which again makes me a little more suspicious and be assuaged until we get much better evidence than has been reported so far add that some places are reporting that this may have been connected with asteroid 2014 rc which passed by the earth on sunday although this was a near miss 2014 rc got less than 40000 km from earth i am very very doubtful of a connection the asteroid passed at utc sunday which was noon nicaragua time 12 hours or so after whatever happened in managua incredibly unlikely that a small piece of that asteroid was that far ahead of the main mass and still managed to hit us the asteroid was moving at 40000 kilometers per hour so it was still farther away than the moon when this event occurred based on what seen so far bet against but been wrong before until i see confirmed video or actual confirmed meteorite fragments remain doubtful

1732,the new york police department which has been arresting tens of thousands of people a year for marijuana possession is poised to stop making such arrests and to issue tickets instead according to law enforcement officials and this year the new brooklyn district attorney kenneth thompson said he would stop prosecuting such cases but his announcement did not go over well with de blasio and his police commissioner william bratton who vowed to continue making marijuana arrests the de blasio administration is publicly embracing the notion that such possession merits different treatment and with the changes city hall is moving to retake control of a politically potent issue that has enormous resonance in the black and latino communities where a vast majority of marijuana arrests have taken place blacks and hispanics represented 86 percent of those arrested for marijuana possession in the city according to a study written in part by harry levine a sociology professor at queens college who is a director of the marijuana arrest research project and many questions remain unanswered under the new policy for example will the 25 grams or less that constitutes misdemeanor possession under state law be the threshold below which a summons is issued will a lit marijuana cigarette be treated differently from a packet of unsmoked cannabis other key questions such as the cost of the fines or whether a criminal record would typically result from a summons may not be up to city hall as de blasio prepares for his first meeting with the five district attorneys a spokeswoman for the mayor marti adams declined to comment on the proposed policy change although officials in two of the district offices confirmed that the de blasio administration was working on a new policy for how the police handle marijuana cases thompson expressed concern about the plan calling it an around the district attorneys that could end up hurting some of the very people the changes are supposed to help the brooklyn district office has dismissed 849 misdemeanor marijuana cases involving police arrests or about 34 percent of the total 2526 such cases in brooklyn it appears that instead of being arrested those given a ticket for marijuana will be told to appear in a courtroom but the new policy could push prosecutors out of the process because summonses issued without an accompanying arrest generally do not receive prosecutorial review these cases should be subject to prosecutorial thompson said allowing these cases to avoid early review by issuing a summons there is a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place these cases will move forward even when due process violations might have the brooklyn district attorney credit bebeto press but the illegal unconstitutional stop and frisk a highly addictive substance lethal in a myriad of ways with no established medicinal use and which is the 1 gateway he said there are currently about million active warrants in new york relating to missed court dates and unpaid fines for misdemeanors and noncriminal violations in 2013 people failed to pay or show up to court about a quarter of the time for the 329198 summons cases on the dockets of the lowest level criminal courts according to court statistics more than half of those arrested for marijuana were released a couple of hours after being brought to a station house according to 2012 data gathered by the criminal justice agency a nonprofit that assists with bail determinations they were fingerprinted checked for warrants and issued a ticket demanding their appearance in court six to eight weeks later the remainder of those arrested for marijuana possession were through the meaning they were held for up to 24 hours before being arraigned before a judge the debate over marijuana arrests has been less about drug decriminalization than it has been about the aggressive tactics that came to define the police strategies during the bloomberg administration the police arrested as many as 50000 people a year on minor marijuana charges meaning that some years approximately one in eight arrests made by the police was for marijuana in some cases arrests were made after officers stopped people under dubious circumstances and instructed them to remove any contraband from their pockets the legislature in new york moved to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana that were not in public view that meant that carrying a small bag of marijuana hidden in a pocket was supposed to be a violation that did not amount to a crime but since the the police have routinely arrested people they found with marijuana and charged them with a misdemeanor even though it was only supposed to apply to marijuana that was burning or discovered in in 2011 the police commissioner at the time raymond kelly issued an unusual order reminding officers that the misdemeanor was not the appropriate charge in many cases
107,the police still arrested more than 28000 people for marijuana possession and in 2014 the arrests were occurring at a similar pace professor levine said de blasio a democrat emphatically criticized the marijuana arrest practices his populist outrage against policing in minority neighborhoods helped propel him into city hall but since becoming mayor in january he has exerted little pressure on the department instead often deferring to commissioner bratton who has made a national reputation for aggressive street policing combined with an ability to soothe the relations between police departments and the minority neighborhoods they serve the departures of the top hispanic official and its black officer have led a number of minority lawmakers and city hall allies to begin to question de oversight of the police

2230,by benjamin kang lim and tony munroe oct 9 reuters north korean leader kim jong un is in firm control of his government but has hurt his leg a source with access to the secretive north leadership said on thursday playing down speculation over the health and grip on power north korea state media which usually chronicles kim whereabouts in great detail has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on the source said that kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises he ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too they were crawling and running and rolling around and he pulled a tendon the source told reuters on condition of anonymity he injured his ankle and knee around late august or early september while drilling because he is overweight he limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened the source said kim who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011 had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in july which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury kim needs about 100 days to recuperate said the source whose information could not be independently verified kim jong un is in total control said the source who has close ties to pyongyang and beijing friday is the 69th anniversary of the founding of north korea workers party an event kim has marked in the past two years with a visit to the pyongyang mausoleum where the bodies of his father and grandfather are interred if kim does not turn up it could fuel speculation over the state of his health and whether he may have been sidelined in a power struggle experts said the longer he remains out of the public eye the more uncertainty about him and the status of his regime will grow said curtis melvin a researcher at the institute at the johns hopkins school of advanced international studies in washington not kim first absence north korean officials have denied that kim public absence since early september is and a official following north korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble it remains unclear why a leg injury would keep kim out of the public eye for so long although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view in june 2012 six months after coming to power state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days he the next month at a dolphinarium speculation that kim unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fueled by a north korean tv report late last month that said he was suffering from discomfort some pyongyang watchers also suggest that kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on saturday of a delegation to the closing ceremony of the asian games in incheon south korea another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in pyongyang the source with knowledge of kim jong un health said rumors of a coup were rubbish it would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans said andray abrahamian of the choson exchange a ngo running a program for north koreans in southeast asia north korea is a hereditary dictatorship centered on the ruling kim family kim sister kim yo jong is known to have an official role within the ruling party his brother kim jong chol and his estranged are not in the public eye kim was absent from a 25 meeting of the supreme people assembly or parliament the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago however kim name has not disappeared from state propaganda thursday edition of the workers party newspaper the rodong sinmun carried three letters to kim from overseas allies on its front page and has reported on returning athletes from the asian games who thanked the marshal for his support during the competition abrahamian said it was unlikely kim had been usurped kim jong un has always shared power with other key figures and even if the internal balance of power has shifted it is unlikely that they would want to remove him given his unmatchable symbolic value again though everyone is guessing he said additional reporting by james pearson editing by mike and raju gopalakrishnan
